]]></description><content:encoded><![CDATA[I am looking for a person to manage the social media accounts of our women fashion brand.<br /><br />
We have an extensive amount of videos and pictures which needs to be scheduled on our social media platforms. However they are raw which means they need slight editing and coloring. <br /><br />
I am not interested in creating graphics. Our brand is high-end and only posts high-end pictures with models. <br /><br />
You will be in charge of:<br />
- selecting and editing the pictures and videos to use for the social media posts<br />
- scheduling posts, reels, posts, stories...etc. <br />
- managing the highlights<br />
- making sure to tag the products in the posts. We carry about 80 products at the moment in our web store.<br />
- increasing the engagement on our accounts <br /><br />
So far we only use instagram and Facebook, but we are open to also open other accounts.<br /><br /><br /><br /><b>Posted On</b>: June 13, 2024 15:30 UTC<br /><b>Category</b>: Social Media Strategy<br /><b>Skills</b>:Instagram,     Facebook,     Social Media Marketing,     Social Media Content Creation,     Marketing Strategy

You need to be able to create videos from scratch that look exactly like this:<br />
- https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bBv9NXJJgBmSGEQOmmGqykYuodblqNxZ?usp=sharing<br />
they are made with AI voice, maybe you can guess which one.<br /><br />
You should copy content from example channels (I will provide them for you) or make it very similar, you can also create your own content, but that takes longer. Write down a script, play it in Minecraft and put an AI voice over it. Edit the whole video so that it gets as many clicks as possible. The purpose of the videos is to build a personal brand and promote my server at the same time.<br /><br />
YES, YOU NEED TO PLAY MINECRAFT.<br />
AND I NEED A EXAMPLE VIDEO AS YOUR APPLICATION.<br />
AND YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND ENGLISCH VERY WELL TO EVALUATE YOUR OWN CONTENT.<br /><br /><br />
= LONG DETAILED EXPLAINED = <br /><br />
I want you to start building a new English-speaking social media account using Minecraft &amp;amp; AI voice to promote my Minecraft server.<br /><br />
You will receive a TikTok account as a sample template, which you should simply copy 1-to-1. Maybe with a few changes so that I don&#039;t get penalised. I&#039;ll then upload it to my account and that&#039;s it.<br /><br />
1. find a sample video from the sample channel<br />
2. download the video and turn it into a script<br />
3. start a recording on OBS with best 9:16 settings<br />
(look on tiktok minecraft videos how they do it)<br />
4. go into Minecraft and convert the video while speaking the text so that you can use the AI voice better later on<br />
5. generate the voice according to our specifications with ElevenLabs (the text should also be in your script)<br />
6. open CapCut and enter the Minecraft video and the AI voice there<br />
7. cut everything together so that it looks 90% like the example, maybe even better with more&nbsp;&nbsp;effects, things happening, and so on...<br />
8. send me the video<br /><br />
I need 3 videos every day, you can do this every day or produce everything in one go, it&#039;s just important to me that I can upload 3 every day. <br /><br />
You will probably also need a filming partner to help you record classic trolling videos. Just someone who owns Minecraft and runs around with you on my server. That&#039;s it.<br /><br />
= PAYMENT =<br /><br />
I want you to have a vested interest in making the videos as good as possible and think about how to get even more clicks. This is a full-time job with opportunities for advancement. So a bigger income. <br /><br />
I want you to earn money from this account in the future.<br />
This means that you will also earn a certain percentage of clicks.<br />
For example, you could say that 20% of the advertising revenue and placements will go into your pocket and we will increase this up to 50% depending on how well you work. That can easily be $1,000 to $5,000 if the videos are well clicked. But first the account has to be monetised, which will take a few weeks or maybe months.<br /><br />
Understandably, you only earn money for as long as you work for me.<br />
But if you do a good job and the channel grows, I see this as a collaboration for the next 5 to 10 years. <br />
Why should I stop working with a system that works?<br /><br />
Currently the monthly payment is 300$, but this is also variable. Depending on how good your work is, it can range from $200 to $400.<br /><br />
Salary increases are also possible, but this has to get off to a good start and work for me.<br /><br />
= YOUR APPLICATION = <br /><br />
I can best assess your work if you finish a video and simply send it to me. Then I&#039;ll know straight away whether you&#039;re suitable for the job or not.<br /><br />
You should copy two different kinds of this video here:<br />
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bBv9NXJJgBmSGEQOmmGqykYuodblqNxZ?usp=sharing<br /><br />
Maybe you can even manage to make the video better. By that I mean sound effects, better editing, more elements for a dopamine kick for the viewer.<br /><br />
= IMPORTANT =<br /><br />
Please consider this your full-time job.<br />
I don&#039;t want you to do other things on the side, as I want to give you opportunities for advancement and a second job.<br /><br />
So if you get one account running well, maybe we can duplicate the whole thing and you can take care of content for two accounts.<br /><br />
You decide with your work what hourly wage you get. If you find a good method/workflow, you might have produced 6 videos in just 5 hours. That would be great, of course.<br /><br />
You&#039;ll probably already notice how time-consuming it is with your application video and how much potential there is for optimisation.<br /><br />
Finding a good example account can save you a lot of time writing your video script or a good prompt on ChatGPT for video ideas.<br /><br />
Finding certain settings in the editing software (CapCut) can help you create your next videos much faster. You don&#039;t have to search for sound effects if you already have a few, fonts, music and so on. Of course, you always have to be on the lookout for something new, but not for everything. LEMONMILK, for example, is a good font, but please bring your own creativity to it.<br /><br />
You have a chance to build up a really good income here.<br /><br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $300

You will download footage for that topic, and you will add it together with the narration and create a video. Then, you will send the final video to us.<br /><br />
If you&#039;re interested, please include some samples of your past work so we can decide if you&#039;re a good fit. If you don&#039;t have samples, we will provide the first topic with a script and a voiceover for you to edit.<br /><br /><b>Budget</b>: $25
