We&amp;#039;re developing a SaaS solution. For this product I&amp;#039;m looking to have a short demonstration video produced. I&amp;#039;ll deliver you the SaaS tool. From there I expect you to:&lt;br /&gt;
- Screen record the tool&lt;br /&gt;
- Talk about the tool and it functions&lt;br /&gt;
- Prefferably with your face on screen as well&lt;br /&gt;
- Edit the recording&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For this:&lt;br /&gt;
- A high quality monitor (for a high resolution video) is a must&lt;br /&gt;
- Good English speaking skills is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If this is something you are interested in doing all. Please leave an offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With the offer, attach a short (10 seconds, content doesn&amp;#039;t matter) video being representative for the needed video. This way I can make a good choice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I want to get working ASAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $3.00
