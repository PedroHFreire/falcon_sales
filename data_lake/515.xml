Please take a look at this page:&lt;br /&gt;
https://go.hummingbirdnetworks.com/next-gen-pen-test&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We like the video that was done on this page, and in this style.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Can you make something like this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The footage also needs to be color-corrected and audio balanced.&lt;br /&gt;
Needs royalty free music under the video.&lt;br /&gt;
You can take shots of this page in the video.&lt;br /&gt;
Use the animated logo at the end.&lt;br /&gt;
Video should be less than 3min according to the footage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are the assets and editor&amp;#039;s notes.&lt;br /&gt;
The assets have the raw footage and other assets you can use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

You need to have 4K elements(Like transitions, Etc.) to create 4K Stunning videos.&lt;br /&gt;
