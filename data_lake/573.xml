GetMoreDonations is a performance based agency based in Boca Raton Florida that specializes in helping out non profit organizations with fundraising for charities. Our goal is to help as many people as possible that are in dire need of our help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Just to give you an idea, we have helped tens of thousands of families in places such as Yemen, Syria, and even assisted the homeless in NYC. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking for a solid video editor that can help us make emotional stories by editing found-footage and news clips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here is an example of a video we found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSdddzjkzpM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is how the video should be edited after (Here is an example of how we edited it):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
https://youtu.be/ceRU9EMknsU&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Basically when you edit these videos they need to show the most emotional part of the refugees story and then get people to donate as quickly as possible. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You must have experience editing videos. Facebook and Youtube ads experience a big plus. You must be competent and able to retell emotional stories by editing found-footage and news clips. You must speak good/fluent english for proper communication, know terms such as &amp;amp;quot;L Cut&amp;amp;quot; , and be able to complete projects within specified deadlines.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When applying please send examples of what videos you have edited in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you meet our requirements, then this will be for a full time, long term position.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;With your help, we can help expand our goal to help 1,000,000 people in less than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The ideal candidate will have experience in editing and storytelling to create compelling content. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Background:&lt;br /&gt;
We produce and sell electric backpacking stoves. The technology differs from traditional gas-powered backpacking stoves, and so creating &amp;amp;quot;how to&amp;amp;quot; content is critical to educating prospective customers on the value of our product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What we&amp;#039;re looking for:&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking to make a few 10-30 second video Ads for use on Facebook and Instagram (in vertical, square, and horizontal orientations). We have created some raw video content to be used (and are open to taking more videos to be used at the editor&amp;#039;s recommendation). This project requires taking the raw footage and turning it into high-quality videos with a clear and concise storyline (we would love to collaborate with you on this). The editor will need to enhance the visuals, splice together multiple clips, add appropriate audio and text overlays, create smooth transitions, etc. Attention to detail and creativity are essential to ensure the videos are informative and visually appealing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We would like to start by having you create 1 ad set (x1 vertical, x1 square, x1 horizontal), with the potential to be re-hired for future ad sets as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Skills required:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- Video editing&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- Storytelling&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- Visual enhancement&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- Sound effects&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- Transition effects&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have a passion for turning raw footage into engaging content and possess the necessary skills, we would love to hear from you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $5.00-$20.00
