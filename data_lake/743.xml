We already have a promo reel for a documentary that never came to be.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Wed liek to edit what we already have my simply &amp;amp;quot;splicing&amp;amp;quot; in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
New intro / opening title&lt;br /&gt;
Stock, archival, and current sporting footage (current video is too focused on MMA)&lt;br /&gt;
New music (Finding some beats and timing is up to the designer, but a big plus)&lt;br /&gt;
New end card with new logo and credits &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Final delivery should be both desktop and mobile / social friendly, even if imagery gets cropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We want one solid desktop video we can keep, a promo reel, and some shorter IG stories we can cull from the final.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
CAPPED BUDGET &amp;mdash; WHY / HOW DARE WE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Because the meat of the video already exists, and we are just changing the intro, outro, and adding some stock video, our logo assets, and music&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;all of which we will provide, we estimate this is about a days work on the outside for an experienced editor, and our budget reflects that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We haven&amp;#039;t made shit on apparel yet, so this gig is for someone who cares about this kind of content, wants to help something grow, and wants to plant seeds for future work and collabation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
WHY?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are promoting a new, small apparel line that may have multiple sub-brands, this is a good opportunity to get involved with us and take on more video and editing as we launch those lines and expand.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We have been designing apparel for some of the biggest (or at least most promising) names in a particular niche space, and seen every shade of success, and every obvious failure.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We are done building companies for idiots.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Its our turn...and maybe yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
EXTRAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will probably want a very simple, stand alone logo animation in the course of updating this video.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;By simple we mean a fly-in, a &amp;amp;quot;spell-out&amp;amp;quot;, or possibly a &amp;amp;quot;sketch-in&amp;amp;quot; style animated logo.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
FUN / THE LONG TERM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There is plenty of room fro creative license with all the aspects of this project, so long as the work adheres to the brand fundamentals, which have to do with vintage athletics, combat sports, and a male-centric audience.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Think NO MAS, Roots of Fight, Violent Gentlemen, etc&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; but with better, more meaningful work, and a stronger brand foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

ABOUT US&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Combined 30 years of brand ID, strategy, and visual design experience at the highest levels.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We are collaborative, open to new ideas, but we are mega design snobs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If your work is weak, we&amp;#039;re gonna tell you.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;That&amp;#039;s how this industry works...or used to...and will again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $25.00-$45.00

</description><ns0:encoded>WHAT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We already have a promo reel for a documentary that never came to be.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Wed liek to edit what we already have my simply &amp;amp;quot;splicing&amp;amp;quot; in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
New intro / opening title&lt;br /&gt;
Stock, archival, and current sporting footage (current video is too focused on MMA)&lt;br /&gt;
New music (Finding some beats and timing is up to the designer, but a big plus)&lt;br /&gt;
New end card with new logo and credits &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Final delivery should be both desktop and mobile / social friendly, even if imagery gets cropped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We want one solid desktop video we can keep, a promo reel, and some shorter IG stories we can cull from the final.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
CAPPED BUDGET &amp;mdash; WHY / HOW DARE WE?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Because the meat of the video already exists, and we are just changing the intro, outro, and adding some stock video, our logo assets, and music&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;all of which we will provide, we estimate this is about a days work on the outside for an experienced editor, and our budget reflects that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We haven&amp;#039;t made shit on apparel yet, so this gig is for someone who cares about this kind of content, wants to help something grow, and wants to plant seeds for future work and collabation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
WHY?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are promoting a new, small apparel line that may have multiple sub-brands, this is a good opportunity to get involved with us and take on more video and editing as we launch those lines and expand.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We have been designing apparel for some of the biggest (or at least most promising) names in a particular niche space, and seen every shade of success, and every obvious failure.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We are done building companies for idiots.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Its our turn...and maybe yours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
EXTRAS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will probably want a very simple, stand alone logo animation in the course of updating this video.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;By simple we mean a fly-in, a &amp;amp;quot;spell-out&amp;amp;quot;, or possibly a &amp;amp;quot;sketch-in&amp;amp;quot; style animated logo.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
