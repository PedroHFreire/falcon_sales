We recently sped up the original video by 5% as we found the original cut to be too long but noticed that the pacing of the narration was too quick even with such a small change in video speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Your task would be to match the ambience and feel of the original, IN the sped up video and match the SFX as closely as humanly possible to the original. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have the following Resources we can share with you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. The original video to use as a sound/timing/SFX reference&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2. The Sped up Video for which the sound has to be re-created&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3. All the Narration and Music in its original non sped up format&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
4. Certain SFX such as the bell, ticking clock, guards marching, unfortunately we do not have majority of the SFX used in the original, so we would rely on a freelancer with access to a library and a good ear to recreate the sounds as closely as we can. As you can hear in the original video the are quite a few different sounds ranging from whooshes, bangs, water effects, cheering within the project. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
5. .AEP files given to us by the original videographer however it is believed that these are incomplete. We could not locate all the sounds within the folders shared with us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;re hoping to get this sorted within the next 24 hours, we create plenty video projects and if all goes well we have plenty more videos to create, from short promo&amp;rsquo;s to longer game ads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
