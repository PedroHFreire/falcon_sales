I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a video editor for my YouTube Channel. I make simple talking head videos and my channel is growing. However due to time constraints I don&amp;rsquo;t have time for in depth edits and effects. I simply color correct and adjust sound and upload. I&amp;rsquo;m looking for someone who can add some creative spice to my videos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The video format is 4K 29 FPS and I don&amp;rsquo;t need anyone to edit or alter what I&amp;#039;m saying, the talking head and dialogue can remain as it is recorded. Just cut in B-Roll, transitions and cool effects. Don&amp;rsquo;t need subtitles but occasional key words on the screen with text animations here and there where appropriate and supportive of what I am saying will be nice. I&amp;rsquo;ll include a few examples of edit styles I&amp;rsquo;m interested in but we can develop our own style as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For this first video I want to see what you can come up with on 10 hrs of editing. This is a longer video so you certainly don&amp;rsquo;t have to fill the video with fast cuts and B Roll, just add and adjust where it is supportive of the dialogue. My audience likes slower, more mellow videos, like a guided meditation sort of vibe rather than fast cuts etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If the style and edit you come up with fits my channel well, I will send more your way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let me know if you are interested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Access to Project Management Tools: I will provide access to Freedcamp for our communication, collaboration, and project management. Everything will be organized&amp;mdash;from milestones and discussions to a calendar and task management.&lt;br /&gt;

(We will collaborate through a shared drive (more info later)&lt;br /&gt;
-Finding trending audio to use with the reel from time to time (or at least 1 audio for 1 reel per week) would be a plus&lt;br /&gt;
-Change up the reel designs, Use capcut templates, experiment on reels for real estate/ local city info&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anyone who is starting something new will find it challenging in the first few days or first few weeks. I understand that. That is why communication is important. Message me or leave a video reply - multiple nudges may be needed for my neurodivergent brain, but that is why this job post is so detailed and you&amp;#039;ll get a client who cares.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To apply:&lt;br /&gt;
Please provide some sample work of your reels and carousel post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
