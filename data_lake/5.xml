The task is to download videos from the main firm&amp;#039;s YouTube page using a downloader, change the music on the video, and reload the video to the real estate agent&amp;#039;s YouTube account. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will give you access to new licensable music you can use on each video. The music for the first few videos was changed using CapCut. You will need to know how to create engaging YouTube headlines and Thumbnails to go with the video. The videos are all home tours, so you can either screenshot the home or use a picture from the internet of the actual home. We already have a template in Canva that you can use. We attached an example of the thumbnail. Only the money text and image would need to change. We will have a template and tags you can use for scheduling each YouTube video. Each scheduled video process will change very little. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As you can see, there are a few repetitive steps to do with only entry-level skills needed. We are paying $250 per month to schedule two videos per day for the month. You can work ahead, so if you get them all scheduled you can be paid and then acquire another month if you wish! There are over 5,000 videos we can use so plenty of opportunity for a long-term position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $250

Voiceover: I have a voiceover that is 6 minutes and 10 seconds long.&lt;br /&gt;
Script: A completed writing script is ready to accompany the voiceover.&lt;br /&gt;
Video Content Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
Engaging Animations: I am looking for dynamic and captivating animations that align with the voiceover content, rather than relying solely on B-roll footage. Here are some animation ideas (All of these do not have to be incorprate but what ever best fit the content):&lt;br /&gt;
Animated Characters: Friendly characters demonstrating baby care tips and routines.&lt;br /&gt;
Infographic-Style Animations: Presenting important statistics, tips, and how-to guides with engaging text and icons.&lt;br /&gt;
Step-by-Step: Clear visuals and labels for baby care activities like diaper changing and bathing.&lt;br /&gt;
Interactive Q&amp;amp;amp;A: Animated characters answering common viewer questions with speech bubbles and text animations.&lt;br /&gt;
Data or Routine Charts: Illustrating daily baby or impotant statistical data and routines with colorful charts and animations.&lt;br /&gt;
Gadzhi Style Editing: Incorporation of elements of the Gadzhi style to ensure the video remains lively and engaging for viewers.&lt;br /&gt;
Target Audience: The video should primarily focus on a female audience, particularly mothers and caregivers. The content should be relatable and visually appealing to this demographic.&lt;br /&gt;
Purpose: The video is intended for my baby care YouTube channel, which aims to provide valuable content to parents and caregivers in an engaging and visually appealing manner.&lt;br /&gt;
Length: The final video should closely match the voiceover length, approximately 6 minutes and 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;
Visual Elements: Use of soft colors, soothing backgrounds, and gentle transitions is preferred to align with the baby care theme.&lt;br /&gt;
Additional Details:&lt;br /&gt;
Revisions: I would like to include up to 3 revisions in the project scope to ensure the final video meets the desired quality and content standards.&lt;br /&gt;
Format: The final video should be delivered in MP4 format with a resolution of 1080p.&lt;br /&gt;
Style and Tone: The video should have a warm, inviting, and friendly tone. It should evoke trust and comfort, making it easy for viewers to follow along and engage with the content.&lt;br /&gt;
Timeline: In your reply Please provide your estimated turnaround time for this project, including initial delivery and revision periods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $25
