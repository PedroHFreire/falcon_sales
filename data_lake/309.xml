Scene: A split-screen. On one side, a stressed-out person frantically calls and emails vendors. On the other, someone on a phone smiles and relaxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Narrator: (Warm, friendly voice) Planning a party? We&amp;#039;ve all been there - juggling a million emails, comparing quotes, hoping vendors are available. It&amp;#039;s a headache!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(Cut back and forth between stressed person and relaxed person)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
