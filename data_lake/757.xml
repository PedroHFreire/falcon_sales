This project is to edit and grade the footage from a panel discussion of approximately 45 minutes. We have one long steady shot, plus a second camera generally focusing on whoever is speaking, plus occasional wandering b-roll, and high quality audio is separately recorded. Basically, all this needs to be synced up and we would like it to look more interesting, kinetic, and engaging than just the steady shot. Because it is a lot of footage, we will be looking to use the proxies system in DaVinci. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements&lt;br /&gt;
* Editing experience&lt;br /&gt;
* Experience syncing separately recorded sound to video&lt;br /&gt;
* Use DaVinci for editing&lt;br /&gt;
* Experience sharing projects in Google Drive or DropBox or Blackmagic Cloud or otherwise editing with DaVinci proxies footage. (Open to recommendations of your preferred ways to work remotely with large amounts of footage.)&lt;br /&gt;
* Comfortable with discussions of grown up subject matter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Plusses&lt;br /&gt;
* Color grading experience (helpful for this edit, but open to hiring color grading and editing separately)&lt;br /&gt;
* It is a plus if you have experience with video retouching to remove skin blemishes and similar (probably not needed for this specific edit, but helpful for ongoing work.)&lt;br /&gt;
* Comfortable editing footage of people in bikinis (not needed for this specific edit, but helpful for ongoing work.)&lt;br /&gt;
* It is a plus if you have ever made a sizzle reel to show a minute or two of highlights with quick cuts to showcase most exciting footage from a project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please estimate how many hours you expect this particular project to take for editing one panel discussion. We are, however, seeking two video editors for ongoing work. Ongoing work would include red carpet interviews, photoshoot BTS, remote podcasts, and other event footage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $10.00-$50.00
