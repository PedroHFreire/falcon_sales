It&amp;#039;s extremely important that only candidates with the latest Adobe Creative Cloud subscription apply because we will share project files back and forth with each other and need to be able to communicate.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;When you submit a project you&amp;#039;ll have to submit all assets as well as the project files so if there are small re-edits we can take care of it on our end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Reliability and communication are two of our core values at Financial Potion,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;so please be honest on your turn around times, confirm once you receive all the assets and let us know if you have questions right away.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ideally we would like any edit we send to you to be completed within four days of sending you the information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
