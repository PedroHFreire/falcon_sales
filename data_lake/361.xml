-Generate character sheets for consistent characters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-Extract the movement from videos of actors with IP adaptors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-apply the character to the movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-generate consistent backgrounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-video of characters cut out with transparent background so I can composite the scenes in After Effects. Or alpha masks would also work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m planning on using Getsalt.ai since it is web based and has a lot of nodes built in, but not every node.. so the workflows will have to work with that platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The plan is to make animated action films that look like highly produced films, with minimal effort. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What workflows do you think would work best?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
How would you create atmospheric effects like smoke, fire and explosions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 22, 2024 14:11 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Video Production&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:Stable Diffusion

I am starting a new YouTube channel, and looking for video editors for it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The content will be mainly me talking to the camera, in English, and documenting the process of starting a start-up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I will be sending you raw footage, and your task would be to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- cut the unnecessary parts (pauses like ums, ahms etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
- stitch everything together&lt;br /&gt;
- apply filters&lt;br /&gt;
- add subtitles (English)&lt;br /&gt;
- increase the audio quality.&lt;br /&gt;
- add visual effects at the right places to make the video more exciting and capturing. &lt;br /&gt;
- make it ready to upload to YouTube&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For people who know how to do this, it wouldn&amp;#039;t take more than an hour of work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You need to be able to understand the context of the video, and apply the correct visual effects at the correct place .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am offering $10 per video for this. I will try to create as many videos as possible during a week. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are interested in this, please share your already edited videos in your proposal so that I can see your editing style. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $100

This year (last week), the Founder &amp;amp;amp; CEO of 2DK, John Davies (me) visited the world largest solar exhibition &amp;#039;Intersolar&amp;#039; in Munich Germany. During my 3 days there, I gathered several selfie style and broader technology focused videos, brand logo images and selfies with friends, colleagues and potential clients. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am looking for an experienced and efficient video editor to created a 2-3 minute video, which is branded with 2DK, is modern and slick in its style and brings people through my trip to share on social media (LinkedIn). Apart from the &amp;#039;me talking&amp;#039; bits, I would like some cool, modern, music and an array of transitions which add to the overall feel of the video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Likely that the videographer needs to build the initial draft to ensure that the style, sequence and feel correct first. Then I&amp;#039;m looking for some labelling and 2DK logos in and out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The video needs a simple intro and outro featuring the 2DK logo and Intersolar logo. All provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Due to some editing on the phone, some of the videos may be out of sequence in the order they are saved and shared. For guidance, I wore a black t-shirt day 1, a white t-shirt day 2, and a grey t-shirt day three. I&amp;#039;d like to keep it in that order if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Also note that the first videos of me landing in the plane are me arriving in Munich. And the final ones of me taking off, and coming out of the clouds are to be at the end of the video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Zipped folder containing all resources is 1.6GB, so would need to transfer via sharepoint or alternative dataroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $100
