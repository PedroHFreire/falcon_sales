Intro text&lt;br /&gt;
Meet Mike Cannon-Brookes: the outspoken Aussie tech maverick who built a $162 billion software empire from the ground up. As the co-founder of Atlassian, he&amp;rsquo;s behind software giants like Jira and Confluence that revolutionized how tech companies operate. But Cannon-Brookes isn&amp;rsquo;t just a tech entrepreneur; he&amp;#039;s a rebel with a cause, shaking up the status quo.&lt;br /&gt;
Mike&amp;rsquo;s ambitions stretch far beyond software. He famously challenged Elon Musk to solve South Australia&amp;#039;s energy crisis with Tesla batteries and has poured billions into climate tech. His bold $8 billion takeover bid for Australia&amp;rsquo;s biggest energy provider, AGL, aimed to force them to phase out coal faster.&lt;br /&gt;
Cannon-Brookes also stormed the sports world, becoming a co-owner of the South Sydney Rabbitohs and the first Aussie to hold a stake in the NBA&amp;rsquo;s Utah Jazz. But success didn&amp;rsquo;t come easy. This is the gripping story of how Mike Cannon-Brookes battled obstacles and naysayers to become a global powerhouse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $60
