My name is Fiona and I run thewildpixel.com (do NOT contact me outside of Upwork, I will automatically decline and block all applicants who do).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My business revolves around Human Design, which is similar to astrology. While you need no experience in this subject, I would love for you to at least be open to the fact that this business is spirit-based, rather than a traditional business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here is the technology that I use:&lt;br /&gt;
- Squarespace* for my website and blog&lt;br /&gt;
- Trello* for my project management&lt;br /&gt;
- Loom for my video recording&lt;br /&gt;
- Canva* for my graphic design&lt;br /&gt;
- Zoom* for my calls&lt;br /&gt;
- Calendly for scheduling my calls&lt;br /&gt;
- Thrivecart for some products&lt;br /&gt;
- Thinkific for my products&lt;br /&gt;
- ConvertKit for my emails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anything with an asterisk next to it is a requirement. Everything else, you can be trained on and not a big deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some mandatory skills that I am looking for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Meticulous copy and paste- attention to detail. Most of your work will require that you ensure I don&amp;#039;t accidentally make a bad typo and that you do things per my instructions. I am NOT looking for someone who skims instructions and watches 80% of my video and assumes they can do it. I am looking for someone who completes work 97% correctly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Ability to communicate and prioritize it. If you have a question or run into an issue with the task, I expect you to contact me immediately, NOT a few hours before it is due. I am NOT looking for someone who is going to put my work last. I understand that life happens, but my wish for an assistant is for someone to make my life easier, not more difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- You are organized. I will sometimes ask you to do a task and put it on Trello on my behalf because I am not at my computer. I want you to be able to do that to log our tasks and work together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Fluency in the English language is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tasks you will be doing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Editing my blog posts to ensure there are no typos or anything that doesn&amp;#039;t make sense. Copy and paste my SEO for blog posts. Compress my images.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Making graphics on Canva using templates I already have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Downloading videos from Zoom and Loom and uploading them to either Google Drive or Thinkific (I will tell you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Setting up my Zoom call links (you will be shown how I do this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Sending out some emails using ConvertKit (you will be shown how I do this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Uploading videos to YouTube when I start my podcast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please know: We will likely not be in the same time zone but all tasks MUST be completed in MY time zone (eastern) by 5pm. For example, if I am asking you to finish a task Thursday 5pm, it means MY Thursday at 5pm Eastern. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Other things to know: I expect this to be a long-term working relationship. My current budget is $5/hr-$10/hr at a maximum of 5 hours per week. The more experienced you are in what I am asking you to do, the more I am open to paying. Your screen will be recorded on Upwork for now. I will also do all communication via Upwork.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please let me know if you have any questions. Otherwise, I look forward to your application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All the love,&lt;br /&gt;

I make YouTube videos about crime and police chases and would like you to read the script. It is important that you can tell the story the right way. I will show a very good example of my videos and the voice over that is used also fits perfectly with the video, so if you have that kind of voice then we can work together! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
example video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMgph0K3JZ4&amp;amp;amp;t=38s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here is also my script. It would be an honor if you would record a piece for me: &lt;br /&gt;

My scripts will all be around 1600 words, We eventually want to make longer videos of around 3500 words. Furthermore, we would make about 2-3 videos per week. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This collaboration is long-term&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $25
