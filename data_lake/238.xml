We are ideally looking for a content creator that has family / friends in another country that would be willing to participate in your video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The current rate is $75/video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If this sounds like you, please email over your name with phone number and email, and most importantly, your TikTok page and/or anything you have that would showcase your talents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $75
