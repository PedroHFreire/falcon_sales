&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2b) realign all of the images so the sun/moon are slowly moving across the screen&lt;br /&gt;
3) stitch in family reaction video &amp;amp;amp; add text&lt;br /&gt;

Voiceover: I have a voiceover that is 6 minutes and 10 seconds long.&lt;br /&gt;
Script: A completed writing script is ready to accompany the voiceover.&lt;br /&gt;
Video Content Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
Engaging Animations: I am looking for dynamic and captivating animations that align with the voiceover content, rather than relying solely on B-roll footage. Here are some animation ideas (All of these do not have to be incorprate but what ever best fit the content):&lt;br /&gt;
Animated Characters: Friendly characters demonstrating baby care tips and routines.&lt;br /&gt;
Infographic-Style Animations: Presenting important statistics, tips, and how-to guides with engaging text and icons.&lt;br /&gt;
Step-by-Step: Clear visuals and labels for baby care activities like diaper changing and bathing.&lt;br /&gt;
Interactive Q&amp;amp;amp;A: Animated characters answering common viewer questions with speech bubbles and text animations.&lt;br /&gt;
Data or Routine Charts: Illustrating daily baby or impotant statistical data and routines with colorful charts and animations.&lt;br /&gt;
Gadzhi Style Editing: Incorporation of elements of the Gadzhi style to ensure the video remains lively and engaging for viewers.&lt;br /&gt;
Target Audience: The video should primarily focus on a female audience, particularly mothers and caregivers. The content should be relatable and visually appealing to this demographic.&lt;br /&gt;
Purpose: The video is intended for my baby care YouTube channel, which aims to provide valuable content to parents and caregivers in an engaging and visually appealing manner.&lt;br /&gt;
Length: The final video should closely match the voiceover length, approximately 6 minutes and 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;
Visual Elements: Use of soft colors, soothing backgrounds, and gentle transitions is preferred to align with the baby care theme.&lt;br /&gt;
Additional Details:&lt;br /&gt;
Revisions: I would like to include up to 3 revisions in the project scope to ensure the final video meets the desired quality and content standards.&lt;br /&gt;
Format: The final video should be delivered in MP4 format with a resolution of 1080p.&lt;br /&gt;
Style and Tone: The video should have a warm, inviting, and friendly tone. It should evoke trust and comfort, making it easy for viewers to follow along and engage with the content.&lt;br /&gt;
Timeline: In your reply Please provide your estimated turnaround time for this project, including initial delivery and revision periods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $30

I have two &amp;amp;quot;winning&amp;amp;quot; creatives, mostly one newer one that I need you to iterate upon by introducing eye-catching hooks, splicing different clips together from other existing content and essentially making me other extremely high quality variants to test. (New hooks, new angle, added AI voice, new clip sequence, etc) I need you to actually have a proper framework or system for how you create winning ad creatives, (great hook, highlight pain points, benefit 1, benefit 2, benefit 3, talk about why other solutions they have tried haven&amp;#039;t worked, CTA), etc - this is not the set in stone process for all ads but I need you to really understand what creates appeal for a consumer and makes them want to convert. You cant just randomly slap videos together and call yourself a professional video editor, I need someone with extensive experience who is willing to learn and improve daily who has worked on these projects before and created serious positive changes in performance metrics with the data to support those claims. I&amp;#039;m not looking for a noob I have to train from zero, you have to have a great eye and skillset for this already. I&amp;#039;m looking to pay roughly 10 dollars per video or so, but I will offer performance bonus incentives - if a video performs above a 1 ROAS or is profitable, I can offer a large bonus as a result, but pumping out low quality ads won&amp;#039;t help anyone here. This can become a long term position but you have to really impress me and drive RESULTS. The ads performing well and generating profitable results on ads is literally all that matters here. I will expect you to create me a couple clips to see how well you perform, if you&amp;#039;re not willing to do that to impress me and set yourself up for success, don&amp;#039;t apply because everyone thinks they have the skillset I&amp;amp;quot;m looking for until it&amp;#039;s time for them to prove it in a non paid format. Be willing to work hard and lead with value here,. I will attach a winning creative, I need you to then search tiktok, facebook ads library, etc and find complimentary clips of this product, put together a proper sequence for new ad variants and then create me a couple for a test run to see how you perform. This is mandatory, so again, if you&amp;#039;re not looking to actually put in some work here, don&amp;#039;t even bother applying. The goal is for us to pump out 5-10 high quality videos per day and replicate whats performing and iterate upon those to make them convert even higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can see in the ad I&amp;#039;m attaching it has a great hook, but it&amp;#039;s a bit too long-form of a video and I think this can be heavily optimized and condensed with many new variants. Please again, don&amp;#039;t apply unless you&amp;#039;re willing to make me a couple videos to test your competency, this is a job application and interview process, so you&amp;#039;ll quickly show me you aren&amp;#039;t a candidate I&amp;#039;m looking for if you aren&amp;#039;t willing to do the bare minimum for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $10
