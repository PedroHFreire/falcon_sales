I am starting a new podcast, I have actually put up a video editing job already. But realised if I can find someone who knows how to use Descript it will save me loads of time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have done 6 episodes so far. Each episode has video recorded from two GoPros. &lt;br /&gt;
4 episodes just have the two hosts, so one camera faces each of the two hosts. &lt;br /&gt;
Two episodes have guests. So one camera faces the hosts. One faces the guests. &lt;br /&gt;
All audio was recorded as individual tracks for each speaker. Recorded separately in Logic (which I will export to you)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
YOUR JOB: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-Import all audio + video for each episode into Descript. &lt;br /&gt;
-Sync the audio + video (note: GoPro separates each long video into several shorter files, so this will take a little bit of time to align.). The video files for each episode are BIG. About 20-40gb per episode. &lt;br /&gt;
-Clean up audio using Descript&amp;#039;s auto Studio Sound function. &lt;br /&gt;
-Edit the podcast episode so that there is one long video master, that just has the two wide shots that cut back and forth depending on who is talking. &lt;br /&gt;
-Edit and bounce the master of the audio for the episode (ie the one we will upload to platforms) NOTE: I don&amp;#039;t need a lot of editing done, don&amp;#039;t need to remove lots of words or sections etc &lt;br /&gt;
-Use Descript&amp;#039;s AI function to auto generate 8-10 reels from the master video (with captions) &lt;br /&gt;
-Upload the master video (which is just the wide shots of the whole episode), the master audio AND the reels for each episode to a shared drive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All of this stuff is pretty straight forward for someone that is experienced using Descript editing software. &lt;br /&gt;
Pls let me know if you have your own Descript subscription or if we would need to provide you with ours. &lt;br /&gt;
 This will become an ongoing thing as we will be doing more episodes in future. &lt;br /&gt;
Likely between 2-4 every month. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $4.00-$10.00

I&amp;#039;m looking for an overlap, of solid copywriting skills, and above-average technical skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You should be able to:&lt;br /&gt;
- Organize a content calendar in Trello&lt;br /&gt;
- Design image carousels in Canva&lt;br /&gt;
- Schedule posts on multiple platforms&lt;br /&gt;
- Take my notes on an idea, and use ChatGPT to make posts in my voice&lt;br /&gt;
- Edit the AI-generated posts so they sound human, and not automated&lt;br /&gt;
- Grow followers and engagement through commenting in my voice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m prolific on a few different topics, and my engagement has been low for a while. I&amp;#039;m still producing lots of content, but it&amp;#039;s not getting reach, views, likes, or comments. I know part of this is because I post and dash, and don&amp;#039;t spend time liking and commenting - so that will be a good portion of the work for the first few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will also collaborate on a production queue, so I can add ideas at the top, and you can schedule posts at the bottom. Translating my notes into publishable posts will be the other major focus of this position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Nice to have skills include:&lt;br /&gt;
- Canva graphic design&lt;br /&gt;
- Descript video editing&lt;br /&gt;
- WordPress blogging basics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let me know if you have any of these nice-to-haves in your application. Share with me links to TWO of your best posts (either numbers of likes or quality of content) for your clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Also, please begin your application with the word WRITER in all capital letters, to demonstrate you have read all the instructions. Applications that do not begin with the word WRITER will not be considered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $10.00-$20.00

</description><ns0:encoded>I need a good writer who can post to my social accounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m looking for an overlap, of solid copywriting skills, and above-average technical skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You should be able to:&lt;br /&gt;
- Organize a content calendar in Trello&lt;br /&gt;
- Design image carousels in Canva&lt;br /&gt;
- Schedule posts on multiple platforms&lt;br /&gt;
- Take my notes on an idea, and use ChatGPT to make posts in my voice&lt;br /&gt;
- Edit the AI-generated posts so they sound human, and not automated&lt;br /&gt;
- Grow followers and engagement through commenting in my voice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m prolific on a few different topics, and my engagement has been low for a while. I&amp;#039;m still producing lots of content, but it&amp;#039;s not getting reach, views, likes, or comments. I know part of this is because I post and dash, and don&amp;#039;t spend time liking and commenting - so that will be a good portion of the work for the first few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will also collaborate on a production queue, so I can add ideas at the top, and you can schedule posts at the bottom. Translating my notes into publishable posts will be the other major focus of this position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Nice to have skills include:&lt;br /&gt;
- Canva graphic design&lt;br /&gt;
- Descript video editing&lt;br /&gt;
- WordPress blogging basics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The videos must be made using AI Tools (paid version). 1 video made and submitted every week with daily updates on the progress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Audio and motion needs to be in each video. Some videos may also require subtitles. Creativity needs to be there in terms of imagination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
No copy/paste of others work. (Re-fund would be requested in this situation)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
How would you do it? Have you ever worked on similar projects or do you have samples to show here? *(I would be visiting your profile to see your portfolio project). What tools would you use? You having technical skills; what 1 creative idea would you share regarding this project, about its implementation?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Would need them in formats for Tiktok, Instagram Post, Reels, LinkedIn, Facebook, Snapchat, YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When its video creation. Prompt are supposed to be used for the video creation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hiring Process: &lt;br /&gt;
1:1 virtual (15-30 mins) virtual interview. Needs to be good in technical knowledge because every video would be cross checked by the dimension required for every platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This would be 1 month long project. With 4 contract reviews per week (Payment is divided in 4 sections). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Why? &lt;br /&gt;
I value time over money. This way, I get to learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What&amp;#039;s in for you?&lt;br /&gt;
You would make money (That&amp;#039;s for sure). You might learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The experiment works out, you can land a long term client (That might bring in referrals). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can ask me about how to creating business strategies for growth. Why Marketing and Sales play a vital role for your business. How can you make (Don&amp;#039;t boost the proposal as I will be going through everyone of them) outbound sales easier, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This project starts next month. Also, did you boost your proposal? (Write your answer in form of Y/N in the first line of your proposal, otherwise, I&amp;#039;ll consider you aren&amp;#039;t serious in your own business.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This might become a long term project based on the results the experiment generates. Think original while writing your proposal (add number or percentages if you worked on something previously). I didn&amp;#039;t use AI to write this nor would I accept AI made proposals (I&amp;#039;ll know if it&amp;#039;s AI). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
