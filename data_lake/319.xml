We are looking for a skilled individual or team to update and develop an AI-powered training video for our Enrollware data entry procedures. The goal is to replace our current video on YouTube with an updated version that includes specific enhancements and revisions. Video: https://youtu.be/NWaQTQf9N9o&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Scope of Work:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Script Writing: Develop an updated script for our Enrollware data entry training video. The script should mirror our current video while incorporating the following updates:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Update instructions on how to input a course location correctly at (1:54) and (2:02), using the comments section to help instructors stay organized.&lt;br /&gt;
Introduce the types of course documents required under the documents section before (2:34): Online Blended Learning Completion Certificates, Skill Sheets, and Written Exam Answer Sheets.&lt;br /&gt;
Update instructions for entering a written exam score for AHA courses:&lt;br /&gt;
For courses requiring a written exam (e.g., BLS, ACLS, PALS, ASLS), specify entering &amp;amp;quot;Complete&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;Incomplete&amp;amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
For AHA Courses without a written exam (e.g., Heartsaver CPRAED First Aid), provide specific instructions.&lt;br /&gt;
Specify that the following documents are required to be kept on file for a minimum of three years per course: Roster, Skills Sheets, Written Exam Answer Sheet, Blended Learning Completion Certificates.&lt;br /&gt;
Add a new section at (3:18) detailing &amp;amp;quot;How to issue eCards&amp;amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Divide the video at 3:25 into two segments: one designed for Training Sites and another continuing the instructional flow.&lt;br /&gt;
AI Video Development: Utilize AI technology to create the updated training video based on the revised script. The video should be engaging, professional, and suitable for uploading to YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Deliverables:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Revised script for the Enrollware data entry training video.&lt;br /&gt;
AI-generated training video incorporating the script revisions, segmented as specified.&lt;br /&gt;
Video format suitable for uploading to YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Proven experience in script writing for instructional or training videos.&lt;br /&gt;

Familiarity with Enrollware or similar training management systems preferred.&lt;br /&gt;
Ability to deliver high-quality work within agreed timelines.&lt;br /&gt;

Our company has patent-pending technology set to revolutionize Indian confectionery forever. The project seeks to touch the lives of millions worldwide, starting in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking to grow into a world-class brand, and we need creative individuals who can excite and inform through their work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Key to the selection of any candidates are the following qualities:&lt;br /&gt;
Honesty | Trust | Kindness | Passion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our company is a startup, so if you are going to charge multinational rates, we are unlikely to be your client. However, if you feel that your high-quality expertise has been undervalued and unappreciated, this will absolutely be your opportunity to shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Backed by some of the biggest names in confectionary in the US, the right candidate could showcase the work worldwide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Social Media &amp;ndash; Activities (But Not Limited to the Following):&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Social Media Platform Selection:&lt;br /&gt;
Focus on Instagram and Facebook due to their visual nature and broad demographic reach. Secondary focus should be Pinterest for reaching audiences interested in food, health, and cultural recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Content Creation:&lt;br /&gt;
Share high-quality images and short videos of the sweets, emphasizing their artisanal quality and health benefits. Post about the ingredients and health aspects of each product, including benefits like being diabetic-friendly. Share stories behind indian confectionary, exploring its cultural significance and festive associations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The footage is used personally as a reference for making facial animation of a realistic 3d character talking( which is also not going to be released public).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
WHAT YOU NEED FOR THIS JOB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
1. An FHD/4K/8K camera&lt;br /&gt;
2.Artificial studio lighting&lt;br /&gt;
(You need a bright setting since the footage must be shot in the settings below&lt;br /&gt;
 ISO 100, Iris:F9 or above)&lt;br /&gt;
3.A Female model&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I need three 5 minute video shot from 3 different angles. One is a shot of the model&amp;#039;s face, another is a close-up of the model&amp;#039;s mouth, and another is also a close-up of the mouth from a different angle. You are going to record 2 parts for each angle, one is a free talk of your choice (2mins), and another is for reading a news article (3 mins, any article is OK) this makes 5mins for each videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I prefer someone who can keep on speaking in a constant speed without stopping at all (I don&amp;#039;t even want the model to drink spit, the model must keep on speaking without stopping at all)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can either shoot yourself, or shoot someone else, but I need sample photos or footage of the model before hiring you. I prefer applicants who can provide good lighting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $70

</description><ns0:encoded>Hi, I personally need a4K or 8K RAW footage (Great if you can shoot with Canon EOS R5)of a female model reading news, which doesn&amp;#039;t need any post production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The footage is used personally as a reference for making facial animation of a realistic 3d character talking( which is also not going to be released public).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
WHAT YOU NEED FOR THIS JOB&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;
1. An FHD/4K/8K camera&lt;br /&gt;
2.Artificial studio lighting&lt;br /&gt;
(You need a bright setting since the footage must be shot in the settings below&lt;br /&gt;
 ISO 100, Iris:F9 or above)&lt;br /&gt;
3.A Female model&lt;br /&gt;
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I need three 5 minute video shot from 3 different angles. One is a shot of the model&amp;#039;s face, another is a close-up of the model&amp;#039;s mouth, and another is also a close-up of the mouth from a different angle. You are going to record 2 parts for each angle, one is a free talk of your choice (2mins), and another is for reading a news article (3 mins, any article is OK) this makes 5mins for each videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I prefer someone who can keep on speaking in a constant speed without stopping at all (I don&amp;#039;t even want the model to drink spit, the model must keep on speaking without stopping at all)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can either shoot yourself, or shoot someone else, but I need sample photos or footage of the model before hiring you. I prefer applicants who can provide good lighting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $70
