The required video is a to be a video showcasing a section of a website that spans about 15 seconds. The video is to be a scrolling screen capture of the website shown in a 1500x1080 viewport where it will take 7 seconds to scroll through the first 2 sections of the website until it reaches the video- at which point I want the video to the actual video file that is on the website and play for another 5-10 seconds. We want this transition to be smooth - I have some ideas on how I want it to look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is to be used as an asset we are preparing for our site as a portfolio piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We&amp;rsquo;ve accessed over 100 years of combined owner&amp;rsquo;s corporation management experience and analysed over 250,000 interactions with owners and external stakeholders to engineer the Town Square software platform for the strata industry from the ground up. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We founded one of Australia&amp;rsquo;s fastest growing strata body corp management companies just to improve the Australian strata experience. We&amp;rsquo;ve been in your shoes, and we felt your pain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Fast forward to today and we&amp;rsquo;ve spun out Town Square as a completely standalone cloud-based, software-as-a-service subscription platform. We never considered for a second keeping Town Square to ourselves, and we&amp;rsquo;ve spent the past five years (and some serious &#128181; investment) to get it to where it is today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Sick of receiving hundreds of emails each day? Been there! Not to mention how many of them are just follow-ups. The Town Square ticketing system converts everything into tickets and merges duplicates into just one place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Wave farewell to the email avalanche. We know the drill - your inbox is a maze of messages, and let&amp;rsquo;s not even start on the follow-ups. Enter Town Square&amp;rsquo;s ticketing system: your new command centre.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Unified inbox: Transform your communication chaos into organised tickets.&lt;br /&gt;
Merge duplicates: No more repetitive messages. Duplicates are seamlessly merged, keeping your focus sharp and your inbox clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We offer a variety of pre-configured filters to help you prioritise the tickets you could be working on each day. Of course, you can also customise your own sorting and filtering options and save them as custom views!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
