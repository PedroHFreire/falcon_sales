Eye-Catching Designs: Thumbnails that grab attention in a crowded feed and accurately represent the video content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Fast Turnaround: Ideally, thumbnails completed within 1 week of receiving the video details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Clear Communication: Someone who actively communicates and understands my vision for the thumbnails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Software Proficiency: Experience with design software like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Project Details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Number of thumbnails: 4 initially, with the potential for ongoing work.&lt;br /&gt;
Style: Funny &amp;amp;amp; Engaging: Use humor and eye-catching elements. Channel Icon Integration: Subtly incorporate our channel icon to increase our&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;brand recognition. Consistent color palette and text style across our thumbnails to create our branded look. Use clear, crisp photos or animation that showcase the destination or activity in our videos. Use a clear layout with a central focus point to draw the viewer&amp;#039;s eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What to Include in Your Proposal:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Portfolio: Link to your portfolio showcasing relevant design work, especially for thumbnails or YouTube content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Experience: Briefly describe your experience with thumbnail design and YouTube content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Rates: Your hourly rate or fixed price per thumbnail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Availability: When you can start working on this project.&lt;br /&gt;
