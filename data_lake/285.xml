It&amp;rsquo;s a pitch for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution, calling for a regular Constitutional Convention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My wife has recorded me giving the talk from my home office. However, on a parallel track, I need an Upwork contractor to produce: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1) relevant B-roll, including stock photos and/or footage, so there is visual variety and the audience doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to look at me reading a script on a continuous basis; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2) explanatory graphics in a few places, making it easier for the audience to understand such elements as how Convention delegates are selected and how amendment proposals are developed; and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3) a custom thumbnail featuring the title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The contractor will then merge the graphics with the audio / video to create the final product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert on pricing a project like this, so please compete on price, as well as offering your proposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The ideal candidate should have a keen eye for visual storytelling and an understanding of current trends in content creation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
