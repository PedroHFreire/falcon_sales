I&amp;#039;m looking for a skilled videographer to join me in creating engaging video content for an upcoming online course. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This project spans six lessons, with five lessons each lasting 1.5 hours and one shorter lesson under 30 minutes. I have already developed the syllabus, workbook, slide decks, and assignments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Responsibilities:&lt;br /&gt;
- Collaborate closely with me to plan and execute remote video shoots for the course.&lt;br /&gt;
- Provide expertise in setting up equipment and advising on effective filming techniques.&lt;br /&gt;
- Edit and refine video content to ensure it aligns seamlessly with the course materials and enhances the learning experience.&lt;br /&gt;
- Maintain clear communication and meet deadlines throughout the project duration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
- Proven experience in videography, particularly in educational or instructional content creation.&lt;br /&gt;
- Proficiency in video editing software to produce polished and professional final products.&lt;br /&gt;
- Familiarity with online course platforms (experience with Thinkific is a plus).&lt;br /&gt;
- A strong portfolio demonstrating previous work in video production for educational purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are passionate about educational content creation and have the skills to bring my course materials to life through video, I&amp;#039;d love to hear from you. Please include your portfolio showcasing relevant work along with your application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $1,500
