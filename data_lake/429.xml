Job scope:&lt;br /&gt;
Looking for someone to help me create really engaging, emotional, and heart felt copy for an instagram reel I will be posting soon. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The copy will be very short, probably less than 60 words or so.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;ve already created the raw video for reel (I can modify as needed) but I need help with creating the on image text.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The reel is less than 20 seconds long. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For privacy reasons I&amp;rsquo;ll share the reel video at the time of hiring.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But i&amp;rsquo;ve got an incredible scene of me and my dad watching an amazing sunset together while on the beach in Mexico.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have a travel business where I guide people to earn points and miles and redeem them for travel and on my social media I share experiences of my travel and also aim to inspire people to want to travel the world. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So my intent with this reel is to be something very heartfelt about me spending time with my dad.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The on image text needs to be really effective and engaging.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 You can help give me recommendations of audio to go with the reel as well although I have a good idea in mind that I can also share. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
At time of hiring I will share:&lt;br /&gt;
- reel raw video&lt;br /&gt;
- loom video describing my thoughts. &lt;br /&gt;
- my instagram account.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $30

We are having a motivational event which will encourage teens from around the world to SHINE Christ&amp;#039;s light to others around them. This is a Christian, not for profit mental health awareness, body positivity and inclusivity event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For this event, we have invited a thousand kids from our church congregations in Africa, Australia, Argentina, USA, Germany and several hundred from our home in Canada. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have tried to keep our event costs as low budget as possible seeing as its strictly a charitable event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are grateful to have some talents, influencers and performers that have volunteered to dedicate some time or talent to help make the event special for the kids. Including our special guest hosting/performing at the event -Brandon Leake who was the only ever Spoken word artist that won the show America&amp;#039;s Got Talent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking to make a &amp;amp;quot;dance along&amp;amp;quot; video like the Just Dance video game that will have choreography to our event&amp;#039;s theme song.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This will need to be green screen dancing to our provided song and dancer must wear high contrast clothing to give the right vibe for Just Dance after the effects are added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some examples of people dancing to the song. We are looking for something like this but hopefully with some improvements to make it meet the Just Dance standard of dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Once we have the green screen dancer footage, we have another freelancer that has offered to take that video and do the editing and effects to turn it into a Just Dance style video that our teens can dance along with, much like the game. See this example: https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=1ca0367b36718a85&amp;amp;amp;sca_upv=1&amp;amp;amp;q=just+dance+2019+ideo&amp;amp;amp;tbm=vid&amp;amp;amp;source=lnms&amp;amp;amp;fbs=AEQNm0DVrIRjdA3gRKfJJ-deMT8ZtYOjoIt1NWOMRkEKym4u5PkAZgxJOmIgPx6WieMhF6q1Hq7W6nME2Vp0eHuijF3ZElaTgD0zbj1gkQrti2r6HpgEQJ__FI2P2zVbzOTQnx-xQGuWfPA7_LjHL8X54xCjPigLtLX638JLYGhCvRlpvvGBo-fNpc7q_rU8dgffCadMYeMgxPqmupqDpgcFpVxKo2EBMA&amp;amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;amp;ved=2ahUKEwiUloTLh_OGAxVjhYkEHeYxCq4Q0pQJegQIDhAB&amp;amp;amp;biw=1297&amp;amp;amp;bih=788&amp;amp;amp;dpr=2#fpstate=ive&amp;amp;amp;vld=cid:e57e7c17,vid:D1sJoUkowUY,st:0 &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
