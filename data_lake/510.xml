I&amp;rsquo;m on the lookout for an exceptionally talented video editor to create a heartfelt and dynamic video in celebration of my parents&amp;#039; significant anniversary.

- Incorporate creative text overlays or captions such as names, important dates, and meaningful quotes.&lt;br /&gt;
- Deliver a unique and artfully edited video that distinctly stands out from AI-generated content.&lt;br /&gt;
- Work closely with me to integrate any specific ideas or heartfelt themes that should be brought to the forefront.&lt;br /&gt;
Due by July 10, 2024&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ideal Candidate:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

- You are proactive in communication and can effectively collaborate to bring a vision to completion.&lt;br /&gt;

- A 10-15 minute Full HD video file.&lt;br /&gt;
- A minimum of 2 rounds of revisions to ensure the final product meets the desired outcome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;d love to see samples of your work, especially those that highlight your ability to tell a story through a photo montage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
