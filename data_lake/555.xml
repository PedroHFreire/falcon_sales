I am looking for an editor to help me edit pre-existing course videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have around 120 pre-existing course videos that I had recorded around 3 years back which need to be re-edited with better quality video and new audio&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Each of these videos contain a whiteboard/screen share and small rectangular area on the bottom right corner where we have the face&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;of the person explaining the video. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need to superimpose the rectangular area with the new camera feed and the new audio keeping the screen share part intact as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The audio is 95-98% same and in the correct order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This does not involve adding fancy cuts or animations, but simpler video editing involving synchronizing new audio with the old audio and superimposing new face video feed over the old video feed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 26, 2024 17:17 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Video Editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:Video Editing
