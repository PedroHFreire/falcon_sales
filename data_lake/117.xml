I am an amateur videographer. I have one wedding I shot with a rode microphone on my Canon M5 EOS. It includes both stills and video content all shot horizontally, a wedding rehearsal, a rehearsal dinner, the wedding ceremony, the dinner after the wedding, and dance segment after the dinner. I would like to create a wonderful contemporary wedding video that includes all of these events, with smooth and thoughtful transitions, intro, and exit slides. Additionally, the wedding ceremony has horrific reverb, they didn&amp;#039;t test the microphones before the event. So I would like the audio optimized and balanced as much as possible throughout the video. Secondly, I would like to have a 3-minute trailer of the highlights of all the events. I&amp;#039;m not looking for huge flashy special effects. Just good solid editing with straight cuts panning, zooming, and transitions where the moment is most important, not the editing. Being proficient with sound engineering is very important. Thank you! I appreciate your expertise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 17, 2024 09:57 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Video Editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:Video Editing,     Video Post-Editing,     Audio Editing
