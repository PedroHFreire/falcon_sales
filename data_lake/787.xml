We produce a small but growing number of projects weekly, usually under 3 minutes in length each and in templated formats. We will soon be branching into YouTube Shorts for channel promotion as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
**MUST use Adobe Premiere Pro with an active subscription for collaboration purposes**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ideally, you&amp;#039;ll be able to:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1) Formulate multi-camera sequences in Premiere Pro projects&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2) Color-correct the footage using a single adjustment layer for each angle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3) Edit the footage to match the creative brief&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will not be expected to...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ndash; Fix/improve audio quality&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ndash; Implement graphics&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ndash; Add intros/outros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
...as these will be done in the final round by the senior editor, at least initially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have experience with...&lt;br /&gt;
- Christian churches&lt;br /&gt;
- YouTube Shorts&lt;br /&gt;
- Local service businesses&lt;br /&gt;
- Tutorial editing&lt;br /&gt;
- Podcast-style video&lt;br /&gt;
...then we may be a great fit to work together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some projects require quick turnaround, sometimes in fewer than three days. For these sorts of projects we&amp;#039;ll attempt to develop reusable project templates and frameworks to assist your process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have a video that needs to be produced by end-of-day on July 4th, 2024. Here is the video we produced most recently using a template we&amp;#039;re able to provide to you from our Adobe Premiere Pro Production: https://f.io/WEF4aE7b&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
PAYMENT&lt;br /&gt;
We will be offering test contracts for up to $500USD and would like to have multiple editors available. Each video assignment will be billed as an individual milestone and we&amp;#039;re open to renegotiating our arrangements at the end of the test contract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $500
