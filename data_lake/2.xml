My goal is to create videos similar to this channel:&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/@BradNolanz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For this job, I&amp;#039;d like you to edit together the clips and audio that I will provide. The final videos should be:&lt;br /&gt;
- Edited to combine the best parts of multiple clips into an engaging 30-60s video&lt;br /&gt;
- Cleaned up to remove or minimize any watermarks&lt;br /&gt;
- Timed and edited to align well with voiceover that I will provide separately&lt;br /&gt;
- Remove all periods, commas, dashes, or any punctuation in the subtitles&lt;br /&gt;
- Feel free to get creative with the editing to really engage the viewer and tell a story with each video. The pacing, cuts, and any effects should keep the viewer engaged while maintaining a wholesome, heartwarming tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m offering $20 for the video, start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please let me know if you have any other questions! I&amp;#039;m excited to work with a skilled, creative editor to make this channel a success.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Script:&lt;br /&gt;
You won&amp;rsquo;t believe what this dog did when he saw a small kitten drowning in the water. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The dog spotted a kitten in the lake crying out for help as she tried to claw her way back to the ground with her tiny paws. He stood right at the edge of the lake and tried to reach for her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But when he realized she was too far away, he jumped into the water with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The dog gently grabbed the kitten in his mouth and for a moment, the kitten struggled against him, not realizing that he was her savior. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But as the dog carried her to safety, the kitten calmed down and began to trust him. The dog rushed out of the water, soaked and shaking, but breathing a sigh of relief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The kitten will forever remember this kind dog. If you find this story heartwarming, please subscribe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $20
