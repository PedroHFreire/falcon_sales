~Event Details~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- 15-30 senior marketing executives&lt;br /&gt;
- Me speaking and presenting, with some breakout activities&lt;br /&gt;
- Will be held in a small, elegant space, which I am locking in currently (~1200 - 2000 sq ft.)&lt;br /&gt;
- The event will be held in Los Angeles in early August (likely Sunday, 8/4 - confirming within the next few days)&lt;br /&gt;
- The event is likely to be held at this location (confirming in the next few days): https://www.thestorefront.com/spaces/united-states/california/los-angeles/32304-dtla-grand-loft-with-high-ceilings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
~High-Level Creative Vision~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- My seminar, Executive Gravitas, is rooted in teaching executives how to be their most impressive selves, and my brand is very professional, impressive, and elegant.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am not stuffy, though, so this should be vibrant and creative (not corporate).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I want the coverage and assets to be impressive and elegant, and exciting.&lt;br /&gt;
- The overall goals for the video assets are to 1) Showcase my brand in an impressive and beautiful way, 2) give viewers an idea of what an Executive Gravitas event is like (and intrigue them to attend one), and 3) create testimonials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
~Assets Sought (open for discussion - we may not edit these all at once, but my goal is to create these assets from the footage filmed)~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Sizzle reel (longer form, 2+ minutes)&lt;br /&gt;
- Set of short clips for digital ads and other use (10-30sec)&lt;br /&gt;
- Short testimonials from select attendees (15-30sec)&lt;br /&gt;
- Separate footage of me describing the event (like an interview but no interviewer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
~Here are a few examples of videos from successful speakers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Keep in mind, mine will only have footage taken at this event, there will not be other media pulled into mine (our project will source footage from a single event / filming instance)~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChHNTCf1jdw&lt;br /&gt;
- I really like the dynamic and energetic editing that convinces the viewer of his skill and credibility&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEQxiykY4G8&lt;br /&gt;
- This is a good example of interview style footage woven into event footage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $50.00-$125.00

We have an upcoming project in Indio, CA. We will be shooting photo content of the property in the afternoon/evening of Thursday June 27th, and would like to hire a videographer to come out that day as well. Experience with social media content creation &amp;amp;amp; real estate videography is preferred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking for a videographer who can capture social media content (vertical orientation) of the interior design, as well as some drone footage. Regarding deliverables, we&amp;#039;re looking for the items outlined in this document:&lt;br /&gt;
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j4F83VvY57bv0_3Kq3Wn-84_TQxflPcKXtoEITEMhWw/edit?usp=sharing &lt;br /&gt;
^included in this document are links to our &amp;amp;quot;inspiration&amp;amp;quot; videos as a style benchmark&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As you&amp;#039;ll see the deliverables should require very little editing. We mostly want the clips outlined in the shot lists (edited w/ any necessary color correction) delivered separately, and 1 walkthrough video. We won&amp;#039;t need you to compile full IG reels/TiktToks with this content&amp;mdash;our internal team will handle that part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The location is a 2,129 sqft home with 3 bedrooms, a living room, dining room, as well as a pool and other outdoor amenities in the backyard. Judging by similar shoots we&amp;#039;ve done in the past, I&amp;#039;d expect the filming time to take around 3-4 hours, depending on how quickly you work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are interested in and available for this shoot on June 27th, I&amp;#039;d appreciate it if you could send over a couple of samples (social media videos preferably) that demonstrate your comfort-level with the style we&amp;#039;re aiming for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $600

We work with influencers directly to create the content, but need an experienced Video Editor to edit the videos and take them to the next level. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;re looking for someone who&amp;rsquo;s detail oriented but also creative and can come up with original ideas to help us improve. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are the typical tasks you would work on:
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Add sounds, cuts and interesting transitions to make our ads &amp;ldquo;scroll stoppers&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
2. Add transitions to make it easier and clearer for users to understand what we do (ex overlay our app on top of the screen so users see what the app does while the influencer is talking)&lt;br /&gt;
3. In general, you will use Video Editing as a tool to make our ads more fun and engaging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our goal is to make our ads insanely fun and entertaining so that users actually love watching them. People hate ads so this is a very high bar. But our ads will be different and more interesting and more shareable and you will help us get there! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If this sounds interesting to you please apply. And please send me few samples of past work you&amp;rsquo;ve done that showcases your video editing skills. Thanks! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $75.00-$120.00

I will be onsite the whole time working through each shot with you since I don&amp;#039;t have a clear plan on how its all going to be edited together yet. The goal is to get some great material that I can piece together and use in multiple settings such as on our website, socials, and any ad related functions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our plant is in Monroe, OH and I will need to have someone onsite ideally sometime between 6/24-6/27. I don&amp;#039;t anticipate it should be more than a few hours of work taking the actual footage + how ever long it takes for editting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
