For this job, I&amp;#039;d like you to find 3 different clips that I can use to voiceover and edit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My goal is to create videos similar to those on the Brad Nolan youtube channel:&lt;br /&gt;
 - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/22KkTmE-cwY&lt;br /&gt;
 - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/34jYd0SICDE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So I &amp;#039;d like you to find clips similar to those featured in the linked videos and other animal ones on that channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To be clear, I DON&amp;#039;T want finished videos like the ones linked, but rather similar clips to the ones those videos use. The videos are just to give you an idea of what the finished product will look like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;d like the clips to have no watermark or a small watermark that can be easily hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;d also prefer the videos that aren&amp;#039;t too popular or come from less popular platforms such as vk or douyin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please no clips from Youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m paying $4 per clip, and will HIRE AGAIN if the job is done well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let me know if you have any questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $12

Our video project is nearly complete, but we require a skilled video editor to add the finishing touches and elevate the overall quality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Due to an unexpected personal situation, our previous editor is no longer available to complete the work. We need someone who can step in and finish the project within the next 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The main tasks will involve:&lt;br /&gt;
- Adjusting colors to ensure a visually appealing and consistent look throughout the video&lt;br /&gt;
- Fine-tuning font sizes to improve readability and visual impact&lt;br /&gt;
- Perfecting the timing of effects to enhance the flow and engagement of the video&lt;br /&gt;
- Polishing the video to achieve a professional and high-quality end result&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The project files are in Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects. To give you an idea of the video&amp;#039;s current state, please take a look at the latest version provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have the skills and experience to deliver these final improvements and can commit to the 24-hour deadline, we would love to hear from you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please submit your proposal, along with your relevant experience and portfolio, as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The videos are on average 12-16 minutes, and generally list format. They consist of footage of the places we&amp;#039;re talking about - occasionally stock footage, articles/websites that are linked in the script and images to make video more engaging. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The perfect candidate:&lt;br /&gt;
-Can make videos with good footage while avoiding copyright&lt;br /&gt;
-Good communication&lt;br /&gt;
-Understands what a good video looks like&lt;br /&gt;
-Can keep viewers engaged&lt;br /&gt;
-Can do map animations(not a deal breaker if you can&amp;#039;t)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ideally 2 day turnaround&lt;br /&gt;
Experience with trello is a bonus too &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We are an entertainment company seeking a talented video editor to join our team. The ideal candidate has a passion for creating engaging videos that capture the essence of our brand and the event experience. The video editor will work closely with the content team to produce high-quality, visually stunning videos that showcase our skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

- Produce promotional videos tailored for sales reps and various industries to support our marketing and sales efforts.&lt;br /&gt;
- Stay up-to-date on the latest trends and best practices in video editing and production.&lt;br /&gt;
- Communicate effectively with team members and stakeholders to ensure that videos meet project specifications and deadlines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;

- Ability to work independently and be creative without needing constant direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Application Process:&lt;br /&gt;
This is a full-time role. We require all candidates to create a demo video using our media to ensure the right style and fit for our needs. It is essential for editors to be able to choose footage and edit the content in a compelling and appealing way without the need for direction from the team. Please respond to this post by saying &amp;amp;quot;Send Me The Clips&amp;amp;quot; to show you have read our posting in full, which will also indicate your attention to detail. We will provide a large library of clips for you to choose from. We are looking for a 1-2 minute video that highlights people having fun and showcases our talent. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please note:&lt;br /&gt;
- This demo video is NOT paid, and you are welcome to watermark the video.&lt;br /&gt;
- If you are not interested in creating a demo video, please do not apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What a Good Highlight Video Should Entail:&lt;br /&gt;
- Engaging opening that immediately captures the viewer&amp;rsquo;s attention.&lt;br /&gt;
- Clear beginning, middle, and end highlighting key moments.&lt;br /&gt;
- High-quality visuals and audio.&lt;br /&gt;

- Inclusion of logos, color schemes, and taglines.&lt;br /&gt;
- Engaging pace matching the rhythm of the music.&lt;br /&gt;
- Creative transitions and effects that enhance visual appeal.&lt;br /&gt;
- Strong call to action that encourages viewer engagement with contact information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What Should Be Avoided:&lt;br /&gt;
- Overuse of visual effects.&lt;br /&gt;
- Long, unengaging segments.&lt;br /&gt;
- Low-quality footage or audio.&lt;br /&gt;
- Missteps or less flattering moments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To give you a sense of our style, please review the following examples:&lt;br /&gt;

My goal is to create videos similar to this channel:&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/@BradNolanz&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For this job, I&amp;#039;d like you to edit together the clips and audio that I will provide. The final videos should be:&lt;br /&gt;
- Edited to combine the best parts of multiple clips into an engaging 30-60s video&lt;br /&gt;
- Cleaned up to remove or minimize any watermarks&lt;br /&gt;
- Timed and edited to align well with voiceover that I will provide separately&lt;br /&gt;
- Remove all periods, commas, dashes, or any punctuation in the subtitles&lt;br /&gt;
- Feel free to get creative with the editing to really engage the viewer and tell a story with each video. The pacing, cuts, and any effects should keep the viewer engaged while maintaining a wholesome, heartwarming tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Script:&lt;br /&gt;
You won&amp;rsquo;t believe what this dog did when he saw a small kitten drowning in the water. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The dog spotted a kitten in the lake crying out for help as she tried to claw her way back to the ground with her tiny paws. He stood right at the edge of the lake and tried to reach for her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But when he realized she was too far away, he jumped into the water with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The dog gently grabbed the kitten in his mouth and for a moment, the kitten struggled against him, not realizing that he was her savior. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But as the dog carried her to safety, the kitten calmed down and began to trust him. The dog rushed out of the water, soaked and shaking, but breathing a sigh of relief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The kitten will forever remember this kind dog. If you find this story heartwarming, please subscribe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $20
