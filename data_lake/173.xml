https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tybOi4hjZFQ into an extended version of the technique. The task involves dividing the video into 4 rounds (instead if 3), with each round lasting 2 minutes of breathholding (instead of 1-1:30). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This means you need to adjust the sound and design a bit.&lt;br /&gt;
- Instead of 1:00 min or 1:30 min it&amp;#039;s 2:00 min. for each breath-holding.&lt;br /&gt;
- The time between sequences needs to be longer instead of 1 min or 1:30 min, its 2 min.&lt;br /&gt;
- Instead of the timer saying 1:00 or 1:30 min, it&amp;#039;s 2:00 min.&lt;br /&gt;
- Add a 4th sequence of 30 sec. breath in-and-out and 2 min breath-hold&lt;br /&gt;
- Everything needs to be the voice of Wim Hof, the instructor.&lt;br /&gt;
- Make sure that the transitions in sound and animations are correct.&lt;br /&gt;
Sounds would be something like &amp;amp;quot;You are almost there&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;Do you want to prolong your breath hold...&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;Okay, recovery breath in. &lt;br /&gt;
But also something like &amp;amp;quot;30 min. left&amp;amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
- Especially add this to the 4th 2:00 min breath-holding sequence. &lt;br /&gt;
- Add the talking of Wim Hof like &amp;amp;quot;Be in this moment&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;Let the body do what the body is capable of doing&amp;amp;quot;, and &amp;amp;quot;Be aware of your heartbeat...&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;Let that relaxation...&amp;amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
into the extra seconds and 4th 2:00 min. Breath hold.&lt;br /&gt;
- Delete the advertising at the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- I also need it as a sound version&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Probably, the total length of the video after editing will be around 15 min.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
