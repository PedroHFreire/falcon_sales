Seriously. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our clients are CEOs of B2B software offerings, and they don&amp;#039;t need virality to scale.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Their average prospect is worth tens or hundreds of thousands to them, so their audience and leads are precious and few.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But we don&amp;#039;t need to go viral to be a big success with these numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We do however need help building the most professional remote-production B2B agency for YouTube Shorts, LinkedIn ghostwriting and video and point of view / opinion documentary. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our company is named ANTEATER because more important than going viral is being consistent.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And just like the anteater that goes from one hill to the next very deliberate and slothly eating the ants, our clients are learning to be that consistent with content. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We offer b2b content in the style of YouTube Shorts, Youtube longer &amp;amp;quot;talking head&amp;amp;quot; videos, documentary and a variety of writing projects that support lead aquistion. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Right now this role is hourly, focused on creating a few youtube shorts from the raw footage we send (mostly podcast, style clips) but as we work together there will be opportunities to work on longer videos, meed with clients directly and even pitch ideas if you&amp;#039;d like to be involved there too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please send us a few examples of youtube shorts you&amp;#039;ve worked on.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;preference going to of course, b2b examples, or explainer and learning videos, not so much the entertainment videos, skits, songs, etc.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We want some transferable stories that you&amp;#039;ve worked on as our clients would love help making software interesting :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $20.00-$60.00
