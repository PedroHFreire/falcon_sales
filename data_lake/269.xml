We are looking for an experienced video editor to help us create engaging nature-focused content for TikTok. The content will be sourced from Zoom meetings, selfie videos, and voice notes provided by our team and contributors. Your role will be to edit this raw footage into polished, visually captivating videos that fit the look and feel of TikTok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These videos will most just be talking about different animals and nature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Video Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
Length: Each final video should be between 1 to 4 minutes long, optimized for TikTok&amp;#039;s vertical format.&lt;br /&gt;
Content: The videos will cover various nature-related topics, such as wildlife, landscapes, conservation efforts, and outdoor adventures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Editing Tasks:&lt;br /&gt;
Editing: Remove filler words (e.g., &amp;amp;quot;um,&amp;amp;quot; &amp;amp;quot;uh&amp;amp;quot;) from the audio, tighten the pacing, and ensure smooth transitions between clips.&lt;br /&gt;
Visual Enhancement: Incorporate high-quality nature footage, photos, and graphics to complement the audio content.&lt;br /&gt;
Lower Third Integration: Keyframe the speaker&amp;#039;s head and shoulders to place them in the lower third of the nature footage or photos.&lt;br /&gt;
Captions: Add captions or subtitles to improve accessibility and engagement.&lt;br /&gt;
Branding: Include our logo and any necessary branding elements in the videos.&lt;br /&gt;
Deliverables:&lt;br /&gt;
Edited video files in the required aspect ratio and resolution for the platforms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Extra info:&lt;br /&gt;
We have some raw footage I recorded here that I would like to already use as a demo (https://drive.google.com/file/d/15XUPYmJDS3GX36wz0y00OQq0EjURl1tJ/view?usp=sharing). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We can take direction to record the videos differently but these are the types of video content you would receive. &lt;br /&gt;
We would like a price per video quote on these style of videos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Examples: &lt;br /&gt;
Example of video style we would like (https://www.tiktok.com/@mndiaye_97). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The background might just be an image, or multiple images or a video. We would discuss what was possible for each video. We would not want to license endless videos to keep costs down. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please quote me what the cost per video would be in your application.

The draft footage in this Dropbox contains 2 videos. They are 05:05 and 13:03 in length. I would like to combine both pieces of footage to create one video. This video will have two parts. The first part will comprise of the 05:05 footage, whilst the second part will comprise of 04:35 onwards of the 13:03 footage. The first part is supposed to portray our senior legal practitioner updating our viewers on the firm&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts, whilst the second part is supposed to portray a dialogue between one of our young legal practitioners and the same senior legal practitioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Attached in this Dropbox is an example video of how we would like this one to be edited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The Brief:&lt;br /&gt;
- The footage should be combined and narrowed down to 1:30 minutes if possible, although it can be longer if that is more appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;
- Cropping of the original audio is encouraged (zooming in/zooming out etc.), as is any empty spaces where there is no dialogue/no relevant dialogue.&lt;br /&gt;
- Subtitles are a must. Dialogue should be displayed on screen in text format (please keep it the same format which you have used for our previous videos).&lt;br /&gt;
- Music, sound effects etc are also welcomed, provided they are not too distracting/overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;
- This should be snappy, fun, and engaging to watch, and will be posted to Instagram Reels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Intro/Outro:&lt;br /&gt;
- The file INTROCLIP.MP4 should be attached to the start of the video.&lt;br /&gt;
- The file OUTROCLIP.MP4 should be attached to the end of the video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I would like to please ask for a quote for this work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 20, 2024 15:16 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Video Editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:Audio Editing,     Video Transition,     Video Cleanup,     Video Editing

The first part is supposed to portray our senior legal practitioner updating our viewers on the firm&amp;rsquo;s whereabouts, whilst the second part is supposed to portray a dialogue between one of our young legal practitioners and the same senior legal practitioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Attached in this Dropbox is an example video of how we would like this one to be edited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The Brief:&lt;br /&gt;
- The footage should be combined and narrowed down to 1:30 minutes if possible, although it can be longer if that is more appropriate.&lt;br /&gt;
- Cropping of the original audio is encouraged (zooming in/zooming out etc.), as is any empty spaces where there is no dialogue/no relevant dialogue.&lt;br /&gt;
- Subtitles are a must. Dialogue should be displayed on screen in text format (please keep it the same format which you have used for our previous videos).&lt;br /&gt;
- Music, sound effects etc are also welcomed, provided they are not too distracting/overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;
- This should be snappy, fun, and engaging to watch, and will be posted to Instagram Reels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Intro/Outro:&lt;br /&gt;
- The file INTROCLIP.MP4 should be attached to the start of the video.&lt;br /&gt;
- The file OUTROCLIP.MP4 should be attached to the end of the video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
