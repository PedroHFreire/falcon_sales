https://vimeo.com/968592216/4665c44237&lt;br /&gt;

Here is an example (your edit will be more detailed than this)&lt;br /&gt;
https://vimeo.com/968596509/f076cf6b49&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You won&amp;#039;t have to re-edit the entire video you will need to:&lt;br /&gt;
* Change low-quality clips to new HD clips when needed&lt;br /&gt;
* Add subtitles to talking sections&lt;br /&gt;
* Add pop-up pictures/videos during relevant bits for engagment.&lt;br /&gt;

Basically you will be editing around 30% of the video and updating them for a 2024 audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For this job I can pay $8 per video as you won&amp;#039;t be editing from scratch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
