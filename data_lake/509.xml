Essentially:&lt;br /&gt;
A minute of me talking at the camera&lt;br /&gt;
Two minutes of me demonstrating a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Those videos are done. What I would need, for the minute of me talking at the camera, is graphics and pop-ups and visuals (I have all of those). Just make it look cleaned up and professional since it&amp;#039;s going out to a mailing list. I have the title slide as well and my brand has a color palette. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

</description><ns0:encoded>I have two videos: one of me talking, and one of the product demonstration, and I just need an editor to stitch them together as well as do those cool, graphic pop-ups for when I&amp;#039;m speaking. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Essentially:&lt;br /&gt;
A minute of me talking at the camera&lt;br /&gt;
Two minutes of me demonstrating a product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Those videos are done. What I would need, for the minute of me talking at the camera, is graphics and pop-ups and visuals (I have all of those). Just make it look cleaned up and professional since it&amp;#039;s going out to a mailing list. I have the title slide as well and my brand has a color palette. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I recently shot some testimonial video on my iPhone and need to have it cut up for different&amp;nbsp;purposes.&lt;br /&gt;
Ads that will appear on the Meta platform and TikTok.Social media in IG, Facebook, LinkedIn.YouTube ShortsYouTube. &lt;br /&gt;
 Along with the video, I have created a spreadsheet for you outlining different spots on the video that we need to grab. I edited the original video down to this 8 minutes to try to make this easier for you.&lt;br /&gt;
Some clips are longer than they need to be so they can be shortened a little (there are notes about that on the spreadsheet) and I need for you to basically look at each clip and decide....what is most important to grab, what&amp;nbsp;can be left off. &lt;br /&gt;
The video is 8 minutes long and I need 15 clips cut from it, with subtitles in a 9:16 format so that we can post it to all social media channels including TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn and YouTube.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I would also like a 16th edit which would be a sizzle reel under 1 minute taking the best of the 8 minutes and putting them together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
On the spreadsheet I am sending you, there is a column on how to name each clip. There is also a column where I would like to include a message in the top left hand corner of the video with a &amp;amp;quot;QUESTION&amp;amp;quot; that should show up as a graphic. For instance, when Louisa talks about the foot warmer funtion, the graphic would say....&amp;amp;quot;Do you ever use the foot warmer?&amp;amp;quot; I want it to be in quotes so it looks like we grabbed the question from a user. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I need to send you a link to a Google drive so you can grab the footage so let me know the best way to do that, I don&amp;#039;t think I can share it on this platform? Let me know how long you think this will take if you are interested.
