I&amp;#039;m trying to find someone who can tap their fingers on a table for an hour 60. You can do this while you work, relax, study, watch a movie or anything in the background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This doesn&amp;#039;t have to be something you have to record in one period of time. You can record several 10 minute videos and combine them into an hour if it&amp;#039;s easier for you. As long as each video is different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m trying to find someone who can tap in smooth patterns really easily and loudly, similar to the video example here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(link removed)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;#039;s hard finding someone who can tap like this, so sending even a 10 second proposal of similar tapping would really help me find the right person for this, but it&amp;#039;s not required. I added preferred camera angles for this video because I prefer the tapping being really close to the camera. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hoping this will be easy and fun for someone to do and I&amp;#039;m hoping maybe to find someone I can keep going back to for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you to anyone interested! Ask anything anytime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $60

I added preferred camera angles for this video because I prefer the tapping being really close to the camera. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Hoping this will be easy and fun for someone to do and I&amp;#039;m hoping maybe to find someone I can keep going back to for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you to anyone interested! Ask anything anytime!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $60
