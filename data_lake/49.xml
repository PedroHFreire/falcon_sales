This is an ongoing job: you will work with us over several months on multiple videos, as we try to improve the performance of the videos and grow our brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The product is a puzzle game. You will first need to master actually solving these puzzles, but they&amp;#039;re fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Then, you will work on creating compelling videos that could get a lot of views on TikTok. We will ask you to try certain ideas, angles, and approaches to the videos. We will strategize together on how to make videos that perform better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We don&amp;#039;t want a professional expert. We don&amp;#039;t want someone who will &amp;amp;quot;just get the job done&amp;amp;quot;. We don&amp;#039;t want someone juggling many other projects. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Are you a student who spends a lot of time on TikTok and wants to make some money during the summer and learn about business? This would be great for you. It&amp;#039;s more than fine if you&amp;#039;re inexperienced, as long as you&amp;#039;re coachable, motivated, and willing to learn fast. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We believe in incentivizing performance. If you can deliver amazing results, we will extend and expand your role, responsibilities, compensation, and give bonuses when you knock it out the park! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
- You will shoot and edit the videos yourself&lt;br /&gt;
- You will narrate the videos with your own voice&lt;br /&gt;
- You should be a native English speaker&lt;br /&gt;
- You will NOT need to show your face or body in the videos&lt;br /&gt;
- You WILL need to show your hands in the videos&lt;br /&gt;
- We will do a weekly video-chat to check in, strategize, and discuss ideas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ideal Candidate:&lt;br /&gt;
- Has extensive experience using TikTok and Social Media&lt;br /&gt;
- Has created UGC videos before&lt;br /&gt;
- Is a self-starter, creative, and eager to learn&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $5.00-$25.00
