My name is Micah Smith, and I am the owner of StarMade Production, a Christian-based video production company located in Houston, Texas. Here is our website: https://www.starmadeproduction.com/ &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are currently working on a testimony video for Savannah Pastor, Jeff Dawsey, and are exploring our options for the best approach. Specifically, we are considering either traveling to Savannah to shoot the video ourselves or hiring a local freelancer to handle the shoot. This would help save on budget costs and allow us time to work on the re-enactment scenes in Houston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are interested and have experience in shooting testimony or interview-style videos with quality audio, lighting, 4k video, and slight b-roll, we would love to hear from you! Having two cameras to capture both medium and close-up shots is a significant plus!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For more information about our testimonial service for Jeff, please take a look at our Instagram post: https://www.instagram.com/p/C8PSoXLivPE/?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&amp;amp;amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking to have this shot sometime in July, currently scheduled between July 8-12. Please let me know if this date works for you or if you would need to move it to a later date!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Feel free to reach out with any questions. I look forward to seeing your submissions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(Please submit a portfolio or link showcasing your previous work, and your list of equipment to be considered!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $50.00-$70.00
