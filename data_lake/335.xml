We require an existing short video ratio used on our website homepage to be adjusted to social media specifications, that is, 9:16 and 1:1 aspect ratio. We then require three additional video shorts to be created, like the video in length and nature, provided in Part 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Part 1&lt;br /&gt;
For the attached video shorts, we need the ratios adjusted to match, 9:16 and 1:1 aspect ratio for use on Meta and Instagram use. We also need some suitable music added to the video. Can you please provide 3-5 suitable options for us to choose from so we can select from these before applying them to the video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Part 2&lt;br /&gt;
We have raw video footage from our videographer and require 3 video shorts, like the video created in Part 1. &lt;br /&gt;
As we would like to focus on the ecommerce side/products/click n collect at our office we would like the following to depict as much as possible the customer service experience which is more relevant to our online clients, rather than our clinical or dental services which were also shot on the same day.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Video 1 - Similar to video in Part 1, another version of handing over product to customer or alternatively an interaction with customer in reception. Perhaps, female customer this time.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Video 2 &amp;ndash; Outside, Customer being greeted, customer being assisted&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Video 3 - Customer interaction, product range, team&lt;br /&gt;
These need to be formatted for correct ratios for use on our website (as per the video provided in Part 1) and for Facebook and Instagram.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need version with music and no music for each video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
They need to be about the same length, slightly longer if needed than the video provided in Part 1 above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We would like the first drafts to be completed by 26th June 9am AEDST and final files/project completed by 7th July.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our budget is $70 USD for the entire project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $70

</description><ns0:encoded>Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We require an existing short video ratio used on our website homepage to be adjusted to social media specifications, that is, 9:16 and 1:1 aspect ratio. We then require three additional video shorts to be created, like the video in length and nature, provided in Part 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We will work together to color grade, edit, and render long music mix videos (potentially up to 1 hr+).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am looking for someone who can always work on improving the editing of the video and maintain a very high quality standard. Eventually get to a level of managing the youtube channel and potentially other members of a team also doing youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a general example to get idea, but i think there is very poorly done and can be much better: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-ygIXfIkFo&amp;amp;amp;t=35s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Experience Requirements&lt;br /&gt;
1. editing + rendering experience &lt;br /&gt;
2. color-grading experience for videos specifically nature related&lt;br /&gt;
3. image editing + creation (thumbnail editing)&lt;br /&gt;
4. past youtube channel experience (understanding of good vs bad thumbnails, titles seo, etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*English speaking is required (For cases if we do video calls)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As a test you can try editing / rendering one 20 minute video with provided details, music, and footage for $20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $300
