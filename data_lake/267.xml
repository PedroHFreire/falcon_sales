I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a comedic performer to write up and perform 3 separate 30-45 comedic jingles that we&amp;rsquo;ll add to the triptych illustration pinned to the too of our socials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need to add audio to these images so they become videos we can post to Tik Tok and YouTube anyways, so I figured&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;why not do something a little more fun than cheesy elevator music. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Think Adam Sandler or Monty Python, a satirical take on the proliferation of motivational videos and #blessed cultures, poking fun at ourselves and the wellness/fitness world we reside within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to find someone that crushes this well enough that exploring the idea of doing several multimedia posts with a similar theme is a conversation worth exploring for us both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can see the way the triptych appears at the top of our Instagram.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I&amp;rsquo;m looking for a comedic performer to write up and perform 3 separate 30-45 comedic jingles that we&amp;rsquo;ll add to the triptych illustration pinned to the too of our socials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need to add audio to these images so they become videos we can post to Tik Tok and YouTube anyways, so I figured&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;why not do something a little more fun than cheesy elevator music. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Think Adam Sandler or Monty Python, a satirical take on the proliferation of motivational videos and #blessed cultures, poking fun at ourselves and the wellness/fitness world we reside within.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to find someone that crushes this well enough that exploring the idea of doing several multimedia posts with a similar theme is a conversation worth exploring for us both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You can see the way the triptych appears at the top of our Instagram.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We&amp;#039;re looking for a videographer for a testimonial shoot in - Voorhout, Netherlands (near Amsterdam)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

1 hour prep&lt;br /&gt;
2.5 hours video testimonial shoot + b-rolls on site&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will provide all the information you may need - name, phone number and address.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please take a close look at the filming guideline attached.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The interviews will have to be live on ZOOM so we can hear and see everything live and able to direct also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Equipment wise - Camera Sony A7S or better, sound recording equipment, a little bit of lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

For the testimonials - 1 Angel of shooting is enough, but shoot it in 4K so we can cut it on editing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
