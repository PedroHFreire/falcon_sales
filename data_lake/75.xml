These would be about styling tips for various female garments. These can be shot on phone or any other video camera (as long as they are full HD 1080p) . Some of these videos need to be short form (instagram aspect ratio) (about 20 secs to 40 secs approx) [These could get posted to various social media including but not limited to Instagram, Youtube Shorts, TikTok, Threads etc].&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;example - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWDMs8ja_aE .&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;And some of these need to be medium length (about 2 mins to 10 mins approx) (youtube aspect ratio) . example - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkW9TQI2P8M. There is no requirement to buy additional garments. Any existing garments which the artist possesses are fine. For some videos background music with text captions is fine. For most&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;videos though the artist needs to speak English language fluently (accent) and describe the garment/accessory styling.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Upload video on our google drive and also sign artist release form allowing us to use/post/own the content.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Our logo/branding also needs to appear or spoken about in the videos (i.e. XYZ magazine or X Media) . Prefer artists resident in Australia (but thats not mandatory).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;While posting each of these videos we also want the artist to accept collab post (instagram and other platforms whereever applicable)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and thus play an influencer role.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $80
