Task: &lt;br /&gt;
- you will need to edit wedding highlight videos with a target length of 3-4 minutes based of an already selected and arrange timeline&lt;br /&gt;
- type of edit: non chronological, cinematic/modern/pop style&lt;br /&gt;
- adding some sound design elements to create a more professional video&lt;br /&gt;
- ability to choose the right songs (we usually use 2-3 songs (parts of it) to set different moods / or live audio from the event) and proportions for the particular project (we will provide additional details and info to support you with this)&lt;br /&gt;
- you will receive a timeline (either as a Premiere or Davinci project file) with selected / best shots from the different parts of the day which will be either trimmed down to the good part (preparations, shooting) or suggested interesting parts highlighted with markers (mostly party shots) so you will not have to search around the entire footage for what is the best, but will be able to identify the most useful parts quickly and start with the creative/storytelling part basically. We will also give you additional details regarding the wedding day and the project. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements: &lt;br /&gt;
- attention to detail and ability to create an appealing end result&lt;br /&gt;
- existing portfolio is a must and should highlight your experience in this field&lt;br /&gt;
- Premiere Pro (or Davinci Resolve) user.&lt;br /&gt;
- Ability to handle 4K footage (we might also provide proxy files if needed)&lt;br /&gt;
- Reasonably fast internet speed &lt;br /&gt;
- Our work is with Christian / European couples, so we ideally look for someone with understanding and experience with these kinds of weddings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Cooperation: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- you will have to match to a degree your edit with our style (examples: https://vimeo.com/storyfilms/brigi-johnny-best-moments or https://vimeo.com/storyfilms/henrietta-arnold-best-moments ) &lt;br /&gt;
- any voice / speech that is relevant and could be used in the video (short message of the priest / maybe other short announcements useful for making transitions) will be prepared and selected. These will be mostly in Hungarian or Romanian (but since we do the selection, you are not required to understand these languages)&lt;br /&gt;
If cooperation is good based on the first experience we would send you more work ( up to 12-15 wedding projects in the following 3-4 months) &lt;br /&gt;
You are not required to do any colour grading/correction, just work on the flat image (we are interested in the quality of the edit) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you can work fast, that is awesome, the sooner we get the video the better. However delivery times of 2-3 weeks are also ok if you can deliver a good edit. So we would prefer someone who can do an edit within the frame of a month at most. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please include in your proposal:&lt;br /&gt;
- relevant examples&lt;br /&gt;
- explain why you would be good in matching up with our style&lt;br /&gt;
- estimated budget for 1 clip&lt;br /&gt;
- any questions that you might have regarding the work.&lt;br /&gt;
- estimated delivery from the point you received the project&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
