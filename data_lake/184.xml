My company is a construction firm that built the location, so the goal is to have the photos represent our high-quality, clean, impressive work building the location.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The edits for the photos are to be completed and returned to me directly or via a link within five (5) business days. However, this is flexible should the work require extra time invested for a high-quality deliverable. If the photographer has a drone and is able to take photos and/or video with the drone in addition to their camera, this is a huge plus, and they will likely be given priority consideration for being hired for the project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please review the attached document and images for guidelines and successful examples. &lt;br /&gt;
I look forward to working with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $200
