Professional designer/agency need for high quality social media design assets! - Upwork</title><link>https://www.upwork.com/jobs/IMMEDIATE-START-Professional-designer-agency-need-for-high-quality-social-media-design-assets_%7E016e01b15e6fb75151?source=rss</link><description>We are working on a project which requires a higher level of design expertise then our teams typically produce. We have an urgent deadline of getting initial confidence in our ability to produce the design by today, so I will be hiring today for this, and looking to have 3-4 assets turned out today after hiring.. with about 15 more assets produced over the next 3-4 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please see details below:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Initially we made a bit of a mood board, and mocked up some examples of social media posts we would produce, this is here: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1Lmx9B5tRMtIX3hhvhJsZgbKGcJ5qPHMCOyBxto0vS6I/edit?usp=sharing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Client reviewed that and provided the following feedback here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/13V30HC9xvJV25o_qt0vJsG8PY2bHW7yh/view?usp=sharing , with these being the social posts they referenced for examples: https://gyazo.com/a604764ea9b99f4d3d8efb5933c89f1f&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- I provided the following instructions to our current design team here (this is what I would like followed primarily): https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1PBiKWbq8CcGWD2PXi90VR5lA1ioz7HciYOtkcAz4P5U/edit?usp=sharing , with video describing those feedbacks here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JPkIj_OJcX7sciLkIeE7mVYyLkCJVE0s/view?usp=sharing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am needed the three above bullets reviewed, and then the board / grid layout updated with the assets that match the look and feel the client is trying to achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Important aspects:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. Layers being more integrated together and strategically placed matters&lt;br /&gt;
2. Typography being consistent matters to them&lt;br /&gt;
3. Attention to detail on minor placements and details matters&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
IMPORTANT:&lt;br /&gt;
To make my decision on hiring I will need either 1 of 2 things:&lt;br /&gt;
1. A single square from the instagram board layout designed in the style needed to see if you are capable of the design and quality needed.&lt;br /&gt;
2. If you do not want to do #1 because of time or not being paid yet, I will accept a portfolio of yours showing similar styled assets to show the skill you can do. If you do #1 it likely is higher chance of hiring because I am confident the work is yours and the turnaround time is quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let me know if any questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $15.00-$65.00
