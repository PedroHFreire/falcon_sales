I&amp;#039;m looking to hire a Reels editor, so I can create educational Reels for Instagram. My niche is marketing, so the editing I need is fairly simple, but I do not have time to do it myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For editing, I will sometimes need graphics on the screen, transitions, sound effects, pictures on screen, screen captures that highlight which button(s) to press, etc. If you apply and seem like a good fit, I can provide examples of the style of Reels I want to create. I will do all of the captions myself when I upload the Reel within Instagram since that helps with discoverability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Responsibilities:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- Edit and enhance existing footage to create compelling Instagram Reels&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- Ensure all content is aligned with our brand guidelines and maintains a consistent style&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- Stay up-to-date with the latest trends and techniques in editing for social media platforms&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- Upload the finished Reels to a shared drive, so I can access them&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- Ensure projects are all finished on time; I film one week in advance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- Examples of Reels you&amp;#039;ve edited &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;- Ability to work within tight deadlines and deliver high-quality results&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please include your portfolio or samples of your previous Reels for review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $100

We are a Danish ecommerce store specializing in furniture sales within Denmark. We are in need of User-Generated Content (UGC) or other types of videos/reels for our Meta ads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Due to time constraints, we cannot facilitate the shipping of products for content creation. Therefore, we are looking for creators who can produce content entirely independently, without our involvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This isn&amp;#039;t a request for just one video; we are looking for creators who can consistently produce 10-50 videos per month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our budget reflects our goal of testing multiple creatives. &lt;br /&gt;
This approach allows us to test a variety of content to see what resonates best with our audience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While production value is important, our primary focus is on capturing user attention. We are not implying that we don&amp;#039;t value quality work, but we want to be clear about our priority: engaging content that grabs attention quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you can deliver on this, you might be the right fit for us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Recordings are made from 2 cameras. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* We will voice over the videos and put our own background music in, original background sound must be mute. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* Align the background straight: the table line should be horizontally straight (except when this causes the rest of the video to appear really crooked. If this happens, please try to find a balance). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* Whenever a part of the face above the chin is visible, switch to camera 2 or crop the video. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* If the sides of the backdrop appear in the videos of camera 1 (anything that is not black), please crop the video. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*Elevate the video material by adjusting the colors: the white tablecloth bright (but not overexposed), the black backdrop dark, the other colors vibrant. Do keep it within normal proportions and the video material of both cameras should be somewhat the same. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* Videos should be between 20 seconds to 90 seconds depending on how long the activity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* Repetitive or long shots of one action can be sped up or cut down to the result of that action (please choose what is best). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* We will upload our scripts for the voice overs. They are in Dutch, but if you&amp;rsquo;re confused about how a video should be edited, you can translate them and use them as a guide. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* Please insert the intro at the beginning of the video.&lt;br /&gt;
* Please insert the outro at the end of the video. &lt;br /&gt;
* Select a cover photo for each video. The ratio aspects should be: 1600 x 1040px &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The raw videos are being made right now, this will be an ongoing activity for month while we are creating all the content for our platform. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
