I&amp;#039;ve been editing my own videos, and want to try outsourcing this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m not looking for overproduced effects, graphics, or sound effects, mostly the following:&lt;br /&gt;
-Pick the best takes from raw footage&lt;br /&gt;
-Cut out long pauses or annoying filler phrases like &amp;amp;quot;um&amp;amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
-Add music&lt;br /&gt;
-Add a short brand logo clip&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you can do the following as well, it would be a bonus:&lt;br /&gt;
-Publish the video on YouTube with SEO in mind:&lt;br /&gt;
-Create thumbnails&lt;br /&gt;
-Create a captivating title&lt;br /&gt;
-Add a relevant description &amp;amp;amp; tags&lt;br /&gt;
-Add relevant cards&lt;br /&gt;
-Add video to existing relevant playlist&lt;br /&gt;
-Add chapters&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

If this is interesting, please send me a proposal with how much each 30-minute video would cost, and whether you can do publishing &amp;amp;amp; thumbnail creation. I may also be making shorter videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;ll send you some raw footage just to do a short 20 to 30-second intro to see what your work looks like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
