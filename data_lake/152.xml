So basically, I have about 2-3 videos on Facebook ads. I&amp;#039;ve gotten the subtitles, and other stuff, but I want you to make it flashier, and more enticing to click and fill out a form, or schedule a dental patient. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Or you can just NOT use my 2-3 videos, and just make a 10-15 second video about dental implants, our dental office. And that would be it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Either way, I want about 3 videos (each 10-15 seconds long)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $99
