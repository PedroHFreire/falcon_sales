We definitely need more creative edits than just cuts and simple transitions. Any kind of sound effects, swooshes, clicks, claps etc would be appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;
So Please take your time to watch these videos above.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

What we are doing:&lt;br /&gt;
We are an online education company and we create educational tutorial videos on YouTube about online problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
- Decent microphone&lt;br /&gt;
- Screen recording software (OBS)&lt;br /&gt;
- Proficiency in english&lt;br /&gt;
- Bonus: voice over experience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tasks:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Video creation&lt;br /&gt;
You will be recording video tutorials to online problems. Topics about online games and mobile apps are most common. (e.g. &amp;amp;quot;How To Copy And Paste on Bluestacks&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;How To Change Emotes in Brawl Stars&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;How To Make GIF Stickers on Whatsapp iPhone&amp;amp;quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
Most videos are typically between 1-3 minutes long, can be recorded in one go and therefore don&amp;#039;t require any editing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Note: In the beginning stages we will introduce you to our systems but after a while you will become more efficient, since you will get to know each step of the process and you&amp;#039;ll finish the tasks even quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Payment&lt;br /&gt;
The payment is per video. We are looking for dedicated freelancers that can provide 4-5 videos per day. (28-35 videos per week) Recording 5 videos takes around 30 minutes using our systems. The payment per video is $1.25, which equals to $35.00 (28 videos) - $43.75 (35 videos) per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Note: Videos don&amp;#039;t need to be recorded on a daily basis, you could finish all the work in the first 2 days of the week and be free for the rest of the week while still getting paid as agreed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Get started&lt;br /&gt;
If you are interested in working together, DM me a short video sample that includes your human voice over and we will take things from there! (video sample can be about anything: e.g. &amp;amp;quot;How to create a folder on pc&amp;amp;quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
