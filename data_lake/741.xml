</description><ns0:encoded>Hello, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I need someone who is comfortable shooting around 8 hours of video in San Diego California. We are looking to do a video shoot. We need a lot of raw footage. We&amp;rsquo;ve got a team of editors so we can edit if needed. This job would probably be best for someone who is in San Diego or fairly close to the area as you will need to show up in person. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
