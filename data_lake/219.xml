The process will go like this: we will send you the script, the narration, the footage to download, and clear step-by-step instructions with everything you need to know about the topic and how to make the video so that you can edit without any problem or doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will download footage for that topic, you will add it together with the narration, songs, texts, and transitions, and create a video. Then, you will send the finished video to us within 2 days of receiving the instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;#039;re interested, include some samples of your past work so we can decide if you&amp;#039;re a good fit. If your sample is good, we will send you the first trial video with a script, voiceover, and footage for you to edit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
