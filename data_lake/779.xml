The MOST IMPORTANT thing first: You MUST be very good at story telling! This means that you must have experience to apply for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The videos is about different youtubers and will have a documentary style and needs to be at least 8 minutes, so its a BIG plus if you are interested in the topic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is also VITAL that you keep your deadlines. That is super important!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I would need 1 videos every week and I am planning on scaling it eventually. Within the next year I&amp;acute;m planning on having multiple channels. (I already have one now thats making a little money) Its really important that you are fluent in english!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After the channel is starting to make money (it&amp;acute;s already monetized), the freelancers who works with me will get bonuses etc if we do good work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The budget per video is $10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Before applying, please read the following carefully: The team should consist of a scriptwriter, a REAL voiceover actor (male from the USA, UK, or Canada) and a video editor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The ideal candidate/team will have worked on successful YouTube automation channels before in the same niche, have extensive knowledge of YouTube guidelines, copyright rules, fair use policies, and have strong editing skills. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
They should also have access to stock footage sites and experience using VidIQ or TubeBuddy. The videos must be able to be monetized.&lt;br /&gt;
We will provide the idea/topic, along with some preliminary research/angles/samples, and the team would create the content/video around it. Intro/end screen/subscribe pop-up templates will be included.&lt;br /&gt;
The video workflow should include a 10-second bait intro, channel intro, follow IG/subscribe pop-ups, and then the content in the body should be edited in a way that is funny, engaging, and entertaining, ending with a channel end screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This includes:&lt;br /&gt;

- Sourcing and using copyright-free clips and having access to licensed clips.&lt;br /&gt;
- Editing the video in a bingeable style that is captivating to the audience, with a focus on CTR and retention rate.
