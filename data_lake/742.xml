I need someone who is comfortable shooting around 8 hours of video in San Diego California. We are looking to do a video shoot. We need a lot of raw footage. We&amp;rsquo;ve got a team of editors so we can edit if needed. This job would probably be best for someone who is in San Diego or fairly close to the area as you will need to show up in person. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $60.00-$120.00

We&amp;#039;ve got templates for most for this (except the music), and can provide pics and videos when needed, if it&amp;#039;s outside your scope of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;#039;re covering serious topics but want to have some fun with them. We need someone who can add GIFs and Memes into our videos to help add some levity to them. The presenter will be having fun with the subject as well, and you&amp;#039;ll just be working with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;#039;d love someone who has experience with quick cuts - aka TikTok style videos - as well as having a sense of humor with some heavier topics (while being respectful, of course)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;#039;re happy to work with college students if you have the chops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We want 2, hour long videos per month, as well as 4-8 shorts per month. One of the hour long episodes goes out every two weeks. The shorts would go out on the other weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here&amp;#039;s some video examples of styles we like: (The humor mixed with the serious tone is a major theme we&amp;#039;re highlighting here)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
