If you are interested in my work there is lots more to do if you want to get involved. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m making explainer videos to captivate and inspire people worldwide, to set out what I think is going wrong and what we can do about it. In addition to the podcast editing you do, if you have the aptitude, you can also get involved in:&lt;br /&gt;
- brainstorming how to represent complex ideas visually;&lt;br /&gt;
- creating storyboards;&lt;br /&gt;
- writing and reviewing scripts;&lt;br /&gt;
- sound and motion design;&lt;br /&gt;
- podcast editing;&lt;br /&gt;
- social media marketing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a not-for-profit project so we are cost-conscious.
