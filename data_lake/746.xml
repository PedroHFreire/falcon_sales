We&amp;#039;re looking for someone who can film and record themselves in front of a green screen. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Client is a bank. The topic will be to explain the lending process and related steps to loan applicants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Script will be provided: there is approximately 1 minute 45 seconds of content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The video spokesperson we hire must film themselves on a green screen and provide us the video files. We will edit and mix the video. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Multiple takes are expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Client will have perpetual rights to use the video on their website. The video will be available to consumers visiting the client&amp;#039;s website as they research how to apply for a loan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Video will not be used for paid promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;#039;re looking for a female spokesperson who is friendly and conversational.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will define a basic outfit (for instance: business casual blazer with white shirt). We may send the talent a client-branded shirt (such as an embroidered polo).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 30, 2024 20:01 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Acting&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:US English Dialect,     Female,     Explainer Video,     Green Screen
