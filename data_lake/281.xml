You&amp;#039;ll get full length videos (for youtube - so 5-7 minutes) then be responsible for minor edits as needed for YT, but then primarily to pull out interesting sound bites into shorter clips for YT shorts/Instagram Reels/TikToks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The main part of this role is having the eye and the ear for what makes a good self-contained sound bite in that niche.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
From there, you&amp;#039;ll put them through a caption generator and make sure it that it got the right words - then coming up with a catchy relevant title (based on the content) as well as a brief compelling description related to it, and some keywords/hashtags where relevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;#039;ll be responsible for the whole workflow, from getting the original uncut video, to minor edits for YT, to cutting and captioning the videos for socials, to uploading/scheduling them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;#039;ll need a good eye for catchy sound bytes, and a good sense of how to word things for personal development (which we will also iterate based on how they perform plus the tone of the content).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Quick turnaround time is important, so is attention to detail, as well as ability to adapt/iterate in style or selection type &amp;amp;amp; the types of descriptions/titles based on creative direction. Ideally you also bring suggestions to the table on how to improve based on your experience &amp;amp;amp; creative ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is not intense editing - most of the work is in finding the right content to select, then making sure the text is right (from the caption generator plus making titles/descriptions/keywords). As we go on, there may be more required like different kinds of cuts/transitions within individual content pieces. We don&amp;#039;t anticipate significant if any color grading required for any of this. Most content will come pre-graded, some bits may require a very small amount of adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally, occasionally we will also have longer form YT videos (which will also be used for more social clips) that need to be edited in a slightly more involved way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As attention to detail is important, please begin your message with the following sentence: &amp;amp;quot;I&amp;#039;ve got [no/little/plenty] experience cutting videos for social shorts, my preferred tool for generating captions is (X) because (Y), and here is a sample of at least 5 shorts clips I&amp;#039;ve made, including their source videos: Z&amp;amp;quot;. Please make the following changes to the sentence: (a) in the set of options in the square brackets, select only the one option that applies to you, delete the others, and the square brackets, but keep the respective slashes, (b) fill in X and Y respectively, keeping the parenthesis around your answers (feel free to explain as much as you&amp;#039;d like) and (c) send through links to either the live social media videos (can be any platform) or the video files themselves, and for each short video make sure to reference its source and the timestamp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 20, 2024 21:53 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Video Editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:Explainer Video,     Footage-Based Video,     Instagram Reels,     Instagram Story,     Promotional Video,     Narrative Video,     Dialogue Editing,     Video Cleanup,     Video Editing,     Video Post-Editing

Here&amp;#039;s the premise: On stage there are 3 guys and 1 girl. They can&amp;#039;t see each other. She asks the questions and they do their best to impress her. Will she find her match? Not sure. Will it be awkward? Hell yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are seeking someone to edit the footage from our last show into a high-value production. Something someone would watch on Netflix or YouTube as an entertaining show. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here is the teaser from our last show: &lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ba6yrKjEcA&amp;amp;amp;t=3s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are the assets:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Footage from 5 cameras. &lt;br /&gt;
2. Audio.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the criteria for the final product: &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; The edits need to be fast. Roughly every 5 seconds. &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; The edits need to move camera to camera. &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; The edits should generally focus on the person speaking.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; If you have ever seen Love Is Blind that would be good inspiration.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; The audio from one camera needs to be synced to the others as it is of a superior quality. The syncing needs to be PERFECT. (No mismatch between people&amp;#039;s lips and the words coming out of their mouths). &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; The audio should also be improved and be of tv quality. &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Remove all of the dead moments, where someone says &amp;#039;um&amp;#039; or &amp;#039;uh&amp;#039;. &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Boring conversation, comments, etc. also need to be removed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The final product should be about 45 minutes long (or maybe less depending how much is removed) and look like this YouTube show called Updating:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqG_jqMTUdQ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
