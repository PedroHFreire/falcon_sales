This will be a one time gig with the potential for future consistent work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The current role we need to fill is ideally a male, mid 30s or older. &lt;br /&gt;
However, we absolutely take on anyone and everyone as we have other roles as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will simply give you a short video ad script to film and we&amp;#039;ll take care of all the editing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If interested, please just submit 1-2 samples of past video projects so we can see if you&amp;#039;re a good fit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $200
