I&amp;#039;m looking for someone with professional video editing experience to help produce videos for my NBA Youtube channel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Your job will be to combine Youtube clips, use specified NBA highlight player B-roll,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Screen capture of blog posts/images/stats into a finish youtube video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You should also be able to do VFX and create animation or informative graphs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The channel is similar to the &amp;amp;quot;cash cow&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;faceless youtube&amp;amp;quot; channels except I&amp;#039;ve been doing this documentary style NBA videos for 3 years. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m going to provide you with a full written script and links to clips we want to use.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I&amp;#039;m going to speak over parts of the video but the script will give you a great idea of what the visual presentation should be&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here&amp;#039;s examples of other channels finished products:&lt;br /&gt;
Jxmy Highroller&lt;br /&gt;
Non Stop Sports&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I would like someone who is hard working, creative, and wants to work long term. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ideally you love the NBA or at-least familiar with the game and the key players. We will work together to create videos.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I imagine there will be a few drafts until we get the audio and visual presentation to match well enough to put up on youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please send me examples of your work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
