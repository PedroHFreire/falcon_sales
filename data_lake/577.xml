That means everything, scriptwriting, thumbnail etc...&lt;br /&gt;
and a humanized voice over using eleven labs or a similar tool that passes the youtube monetization standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please tell me how much you will charge me for each 10 minute video. TOTAL.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Total price. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I will not consider anything else except for a clear total price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m really looking for someone that&amp;#039;s hungry to get experience and knows they can do that, and will be happy with getting paid PER VIDEO and doing it all. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
