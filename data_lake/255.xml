We are seeking a reliable and detail-oriented Video Content Assistant to help us create engaging videos for our YouTube channel. The main task involves copying and pasting text from a provided document onto a background video template. This is a straightforward job but requires accuracy and a good eye for aesthetics. A finished video sample is attached as reference of what we need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Responsibilities:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Copy and paste text from a document onto a background video template.&lt;br /&gt;
- Ensure the text is formatted correctly and looks aesthetically pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;
- Make minor adjustments to the text placement to maintain visual appeal.&lt;br /&gt;
- Export and send the final video in the required format for YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Attention to detail and a good eye for design.&lt;br /&gt;
- Basic video editing skills (experience with software like Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or similar is a plus).&lt;br /&gt;
- Ability to follow instructions accurately.&lt;br /&gt;
- Strong communication skills.&lt;br /&gt;
- Reliable internet connection and ability to meet deadlines.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Additional Information:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- This job will likely be ongoing as we regularly post new videos to our YouTube channel.&lt;br /&gt;
- Each video will have different text content, so the ability to handle repetitive tasks without losing accuracy is important.&lt;br /&gt;
