I am looking for a voice actor who can do a casual &amp;amp;quot;cosy&amp;amp;quot; tone, with the occasional joke and quip. In the example video you can see that the narrator is very relaxed, casual, but entertaining. I am not looking for a high energy presenter style narration, but something more calming. Ideally, I&amp;#039;m looking for someone who is a big movie fan who has good familiarity with most popular movies and pop culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Videos will be 20-30 minutes in duration, and I aim to work up to 3 per week long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am flexible in my budget, but would prefer to pay per minute of narration recorded due to the variety in my video lengths. Therefore, please apply with your desired rate per minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In your application it is essential you provide an example of past work so I can hear your voice. It does not need to match this job description exactly, any past work that gives me an idea of your voice will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $100
