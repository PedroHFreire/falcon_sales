(For example, an event might be a liquor activation at a music festival, and the video would show the booth being set up, people arriving, people trying the drinks, smiling and chatting with each other, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The ideal candidate will be skilled in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Video editing (both short form for social media, 30--45 seconds, and longer form for internal use, 3--5 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Title design (using the visual identity of the brand and the brand assets provided to create titles, supers and other text overlays)&lt;br /&gt;
- Motion graphics (to animate the titles) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Transitions (we like our sizzle reels to have some cool social media friendly transitions, like old film stock style, or flaring, or paper tearing -- only classy high-end modern style transitions)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Finding music (you&amp;#039;ll be given a brief and some samples and will need to find the right royalty-free music for the edit)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-Sound design (you may be asked to add some subtle sound effects to assist in the transitions)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Colour correction &amp;amp;amp; grading (the footage will be raw so you&amp;#039;ll have to grade it) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Familiarity with different aspect ratios, like 16:9, 9:16, 1:1 -- video assets may be required in multiple formats. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will be given a script that includes a shot list, a desired order of shots, and copy for the on-screen titles / supers. A big part of the job is paying attention to detail and following the script closely. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our turnaround times will be pretty tight; we&amp;#039;d like to have the rough cut 2--3 business days after you receive the footage &amp;amp;amp; script, and we&amp;#039;d need the final edit with all graphics &amp;amp;amp; colour finished 2 days after you receive feedback on the rough cut. So total turnaround is 5 days. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We commit to giving you feedback and direction quickly and understand that slow feedback on our end will result in delayed delivery times on your end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Final delivery will be in 4K UHD (3840 x 2160). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
IMPORTANT: Successful candidates will be asked to do a quick audition on some test footage to ensure you can do what you say. We will ask you to send us the Premiere Pro project back to us so we can double check the authenticity of your work. (We&amp;#039;ve had Upwork freelancers send us work samples that they didn&amp;#039;t create in the past so we have to be careful). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Regardless, we want to see your work so please send us your best and most relevant event sizzle reel samples. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
DO NOT send us any emails or phone calls to our company page; we will only consider candidates who apply on Upwork and stay within the platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you and I look forward to seeing your submissions! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $20.00-$40.00

</description><ns0:encoded>We&amp;#039;re looking for a video editor who can create high-quality Event sizzle reels with a quick turnaround time. (For example, an event might be a liquor activation at a music festival, and the video would show the booth being set up, people arriving, people trying the drinks, smiling and chatting with each other, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The ideal candidate will be skilled in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Video editing (both short form for social media, 30--45 seconds, and longer form for internal use, 3--5 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Title design (using the visual identity of the brand and the brand assets provided to create titles, supers and other text overlays)&lt;br /&gt;
- Motion graphics (to animate the titles) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Transitions (we like our sizzle reels to have some cool social media friendly transitions, like old film stock style, or flaring, or paper tearing -- only classy high-end modern style transitions)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Finding music (you&amp;#039;ll be given a brief and some samples and will need to find the right royalty-free music for the edit)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-Sound design (you may be asked to add some subtle sound effects to assist in the transitions)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Colour correction &amp;amp;amp; grading (the footage will be raw so you&amp;#039;ll have to grade it) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Familiarity with different aspect ratios, like 16:9, 9:16, 1:1 -- video assets may be required in multiple formats. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will be given a script that includes a shot list, a desired order of shots, and copy for the on-screen titles / supers. A big part of the job is paying attention to detail and following the script closely. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our turnaround times will be pretty tight; we&amp;#039;d like to have the rough cut 2--3 business days after you receive the footage &amp;amp;amp; script, and we&amp;#039;d need the final edit with all graphics &amp;amp;amp; colour finished 2 days after you receive feedback on the rough cut. So total turnaround is 5 days. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We commit to giving you feedback and direction quickly and understand that slow feedback on our end will result in delayed delivery times on your end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Final delivery will be in 4K UHD (3840 x 2160). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
IMPORTANT: Successful candidates will be asked to do a quick audition on some test footage to ensure you can do what you say. We will ask you to send us the Premiere Pro project back to us so we can double check the authenticity of your work. (We&amp;#039;ve had Upwork freelancers send us work samples that they didn&amp;#039;t create in the past so we have to be careful). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Regardless, we want to see your work so please send us your best and most relevant event sizzle reel samples. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
DO NOT send us any emails or phone calls to our company page; we will only consider candidates who apply on Upwork and stay within the platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Voiceover: I have a voiceover that is 6 minutes and 10 seconds long.&lt;br /&gt;
Script: A completed writing script is ready to accompany the voiceover.&lt;br /&gt;
Video Content Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
Engaging Animations: I am looking for dynamic and captivating animations that align with the voiceover content, rather than relying solely on B-roll footage. Here are some animation ideas (All of these do not have to be incorprate but what ever best fit the content):&lt;br /&gt;
Animated Characters: Friendly characters demonstrating baby care tips and routines.&lt;br /&gt;
Infographic-Style Animations: Presenting important statistics, tips, and how-to guides with engaging text and icons.&lt;br /&gt;
Step-by-Step: Clear visuals and labels for baby care activities like diaper changing and bathing.&lt;br /&gt;
Interactive Q&amp;amp;amp;A: Animated characters answering common viewer questions with speech bubbles and text animations.&lt;br /&gt;
Data or Routine Charts: Illustrating daily baby or impotant statistical data and routines with colorful charts and animations.&lt;br /&gt;
Gadzhi Style Editing: Incorporation of elements of the Gadzhi style to ensure the video remains lively and engaging for viewers.&lt;br /&gt;
Target Audience: The video should primarily focus on a female audience, particularly mothers and caregivers. The content should be relatable and visually appealing to this demographic.&lt;br /&gt;
Purpose: The video is intended for my baby care YouTube channel, which aims to provide valuable content to parents and caregivers in an engaging and visually appealing manner.&lt;br /&gt;
Length: The final video should closely match the voiceover length, approximately 6 minutes and 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;
Visual Elements: Use of soft colors, soothing backgrounds, and gentle transitions is preferred to align with the baby care theme.&lt;br /&gt;
Additional Details:&lt;br /&gt;
Revisions: I would like to include up to 3 revisions in the project scope to ensure the final video meets the desired quality and content standards.&lt;br /&gt;
Format: The final video should be delivered in MP4 format with a resolution of 1080p.&lt;br /&gt;
Style and Tone: The video should have a warm, inviting, and friendly tone. It should evoke trust and comfort, making it easy for viewers to follow along and engage with the content.&lt;br /&gt;
Timeline: In your reply Please provide your estimated turnaround time for this project, including initial delivery and revision periods.&lt;br /&gt;
