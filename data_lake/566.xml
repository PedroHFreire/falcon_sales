Simple. I need the background masked or keyed out so the only thing visible is the product rotating. &lt;br /&gt;
The footage is not green screened and thus cannot be chroma keyed. This will probably have to be done manually (unless you know a trick or two that would expedite and simplify the process). I&amp;#039;ve already done one clip in AfterEffects myself, but don&amp;#039;t have time to do the others. &lt;br /&gt;
The footage is actually quite clean and the products are pretty-well centered on the turnstyle, so keying isn&amp;#039;t difficult.&lt;br /&gt;
The result should be 6k renders at with either transparency or against pure black so I can remove the background when compositing on top of other footage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $45.00-$75.00
