Currently we are looking to partner with an editor to add video and on-screen text in a finished product able to be posted to TikTok/YouTube Shorts/Instagram Reels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We run a film podcast and are at 130+ episodes. &lt;br /&gt;
Thedailyratings.com&lt;br /&gt;
Find us on Spotify and Apple as well&lt;br /&gt;
https://linktr.ee/thedailyratings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The work flow we are suggesting is providing our episodes/streams. The first few batches we will be providing highlight clips from the episodes, but ideally the work flow becomes Us providing the entire episode, and you finding what clips work best. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Once in your hands we want to find relevant movie clips to edit together a visual, based on what we are discussing. Then in typical TikTok style, edit visual caption/text from the audio. Each episode we cover multiple movies, so will be looking to have 3-5 videos per episode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The plan is to have the same single short video posted to the 3 platforms listed above. We are aiming to post a minimum of 2-4 videos a week, but are looking to partner with an editor to possibly grow that frequency.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We also would love to see any new content ideas, beyond chopping up our episodes, possibly for any trends we can quickly act on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Lastly, see below for some sample edits that have done well on our Socials. These are the examples we would like to have a baseline, but of course open to different styles and input. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
