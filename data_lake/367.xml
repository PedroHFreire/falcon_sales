My client is looking for a video editor for her YouTube channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
She already has a 13k subscriber channel, but we want to start another project, meaning a brand new channel. I care A LOT about her, and hopefully, I&amp;#039;ll be able to find somebody worthy of her. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Before applying for this job, please be aware that a trial may be involved before we decide with whom we&amp;#039;ll be moving forward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Another sort of warning...write &amp;amp;quot;salut&amp;amp;quot; at the beginning of your proposal, is to make sure that you&amp;#039;ll respect any corrections we want to make to the video the first time, without us having to repeat ourselves multiple times. Based on my experience, I find this the most annoying thing an editor can do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Her style of editing will be really LIGHT and soft. Although she provided a reference for editing, I don&amp;#039;t think we&amp;#039;ll ever be at that volume of editing: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvgfzI7rFYU.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you submit a proposal, I&amp;#039;ll send you brand guidelines, her channel, etc., and we&amp;#039;ll discuss rates, possible trials, and your experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;ve worked with a lot of editors in the last couple of years, and even I edited videos back in the day. This isn&amp;#039;t anything complicated, but we do require attention to detail and good taste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
