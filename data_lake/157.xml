</description><ns0:encoded>We are urgently looking for 1500 video recorders who has any iPhone pro series mobile phone to record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some key points to keep in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Person should have only a Pro series of iPhone because the recording needs a Lidar sensor.&lt;br /&gt;
- No human body part should be visible in frame while recording video of the object such cases will get rejected&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
- Light on the object should be good and no shadow should be there&lt;br /&gt;
- Camera should not be far from the object&lt;br /&gt;
- Reflective surfaces like glass dining tables should be avoided while recording the video of the object.&lt;br /&gt;
- No PII or NSFW data&lt;br /&gt;
- No duplicate objects&lt;br /&gt;
- Avoid soft or deformable objects&lt;br /&gt;
- The application is available in App store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
**The budget is $1.25 per object.**&lt;br /&gt;
**Payment will be done in every 15 days.**&lt;br /&gt;
**The project duration is 3 months for now and you can provide as many videos as you can.**&lt;br /&gt;
**You can earn $25 in a day by submitting 20 videos**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Looking forward to getting your positive response.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A very good opportunity to get 5-Star ratings and wonderful feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
