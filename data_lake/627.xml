Your job would be to go through the video, and make it a video that wont be age restricted whilst making the minimum number of changes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I think there are a few shots which are creating the issue. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I want a quick turnaround and will also hire quickly. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The niche we would base our channel in is around education &amp;amp;amp; interesting information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Exact editing style we would need can be seen on the following channel/s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
James Toland&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The style of editing is almost the same, however, the only difference in the storyline is that, we have a human main character that will wear a costume and act as an animal, instead of the animal as the main character.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You would basically get images from our drawing designer who would draw about 99% of the illustrations/images that you would be using in the video and the rest can be your additions if applicable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*After you get hired, you will receive 99% illustrations drawn by a designer before you start editing*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
( Everything would be provided and well organized for you, so you can purely focus on video quality )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Things that you need to pay attention to are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You have to make sure that the video is fast-paced and that things on the screen are changing quickly and also moving&lt;br /&gt;
You have to make sure that every single edit is smoothly done&lt;br /&gt;
Music &amp;amp;amp; SFX have to be on point throughout the entire video&lt;br /&gt;
You don&amp;#039;t need to add subtitles for the entire video, only the important texts (keywords)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Initial compensation that we are offering for this project is 10$ per minute of final video ( as soon as the channel picks up and starts being stable, we will bump it to 11-12$, and as time goes more.. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You would also receive bonuses from time to time based on your channel&amp;#039;s performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We would need about 8-10 videos edited monthly ( likely more as the channel picks up ) and each video would be 10-13 min long usually&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We look forward to working with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $2,000
