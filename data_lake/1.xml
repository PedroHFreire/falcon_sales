I have 8 hours of video and audio recordings of a sales expert and myself discussing and demonstrating the language for a new webinar. I need someone to review these recordings, identify the specific segments where the expert is demonstrating the language for the webinar, compile these segments into a single audio file with timestamps, and provide transcriptions for each clip using AI-based transcription tools.&lt;br /&gt;
I do not need our personal conversation - so you&amp;#039;ll have to listen and determine what is what. He told me stories and gave a presentation that he wrote, so its very important to comprehend the information. I am a weight loss coach, and he rewrote my presentation using subconscious language, stories, and examples. The examples, and stories he uses are very important. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
**Responsibilities:**&lt;br /&gt;
- Watch 8 hours of video and audio content.&lt;br /&gt;
- Identify and note the start and end timestamps of segments where the sales expert demonstrates the language for the new webinar.&lt;br /&gt;
- Extract these segments and compile them into a single audio file.&lt;br /&gt;
- Use AI-based transcription tools to create transcriptions for each extracted segment.&lt;br /&gt;
- Pair each transcription with its corresponding audio clip.&lt;br /&gt;
- Provide a list of timestamps with brief descriptions of the content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
**Requirements:**&lt;br /&gt;
- Attention to detail.&lt;br /&gt;
- Ability to understand and follow instructions.&lt;br /&gt;
- Previous experience in video/audio editing or transcription is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;
- Proficiency in using audio editing tools such as Audacity, Adobe Audition, etc.&lt;br /&gt;
- Familiarity with AI-based transcription tools like Otter.ai, Descript, or similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
**Deliverables:**&lt;br /&gt;
- A document listing the timestamps and brief descriptions of the identified segments.&lt;br /&gt;
- A single audio file containing all the extracted segments compiled together.&lt;br /&gt;
- Transcriptions for each audio clip, paired with the corresponding clip. And time stamped &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $150
