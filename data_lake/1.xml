~Event Details~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- 15-30 senior marketing executives&lt;br /&gt;
- Me speaking and presenting, with some breakout activities&lt;br /&gt;
- Will be held in a small, elegant space, which I am locking in currently (~1200 - 2000 sq ft.)&lt;br /&gt;
- The event will be held in Los Angeles in early August (likely Sunday, 8/4 - confirming within the next few days)&lt;br /&gt;
- The event is likely to be held at this location (confirming in the next few days): https://www.thestorefront.com/spaces/united-states/california/los-angeles/32304-dtla-grand-loft-with-high-ceilings&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
~High-Level Creative Vision~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- My seminar, Executive Gravitas, is rooted in teaching executives how to be their most impressive selves, and my brand is very professional, impressive, and elegant.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am not stuffy, though, so this should be vibrant and creative (not corporate).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I want the coverage and assets to be impressive and elegant, and exciting.&lt;br /&gt;
- The overall goals for the video assets are to 1) Showcase my brand in an impressive and beautiful way, 2) give viewers an idea of what an Executive Gravitas event is like (and intrigue them to attend one), and 3) create testimonials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
~Assets Sought (open for discussion - we may not edit these all at once, but my goal is to create these assets from the footage filmed)~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Sizzle reel (longer form, 2+ minutes)&lt;br /&gt;
- Set of short clips for digital ads and other use (10-30sec)&lt;br /&gt;
- Short testimonials from select attendees (15-30sec)&lt;br /&gt;
- Separate footage of me describing the event (like an interview but no interviewer)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
~Here are a few examples of videos from successful speakers.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Keep in mind, mine will only have footage taken at this event, there will not be other media pulled into mine (our project will source footage from a single event / filming instance)~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChHNTCf1jdw&lt;br /&gt;
- I really like the dynamic and energetic editing that convinces the viewer of his skill and credibility&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEQxiykY4G8&lt;br /&gt;
- This is a good example of interview style footage woven into event footage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $50.00-$125.00

For this job, I&amp;#039;d like you to find 3 different clips that I can use to voiceover and edit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My goal is to create videos similar to those on the Brad Nolan youtube channel:&lt;br /&gt;
 - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/22KkTmE-cwY&lt;br /&gt;
 - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/34jYd0SICDE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So I &amp;#039;d like you to find clips similar to those featured in the linked videos and other animal ones on that channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To be clear, I DON&amp;#039;T want finished videos like the ones linked, but rather similar clips to the ones those videos use. The videos are just to give you an idea of what the finished product will look like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;d like the clips to have no watermark or a small watermark that can be easily hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;d also prefer the videos that aren&amp;#039;t too popular or come from less popular platforms such as vk or douyin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please no clips from Youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m paying $4 per clip, and will HIRE AGAIN if the job is done well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let me know if you have any questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $12

Our video project is nearly complete, but we require a skilled video editor to add the finishing touches and elevate the overall quality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Due to an unexpected personal situation, our previous editor is no longer available to complete the work. We need someone who can step in and finish the project within the next 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The main tasks will involve:&lt;br /&gt;
- Adjusting colors to ensure a visually appealing and consistent look throughout the video&lt;br /&gt;
- Fine-tuning font sizes to improve readability and visual impact&lt;br /&gt;
- Perfecting the timing of effects to enhance the flow and engagement of the video&lt;br /&gt;
- Polishing the video to achieve a professional and high-quality end result&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The project files are in Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects. To give you an idea of the video&amp;#039;s current state, please take a look at the latest version provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have the skills and experience to deliver these final improvements and can commit to the 24-hour deadline, we would love to hear from you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
