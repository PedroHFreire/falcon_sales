We want the exact same animation with a few modifications:&lt;br /&gt;
- Whenever it says WGN-TV, we would want HTD-TV (the 9 does not have to stay)&lt;br /&gt;
- Instead of 1984 Chicago Cubs Baseball, we would want &amp;amp;quot;2024 Hometown Cup Finals&amp;amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
-Instead of the Cubs logo we would want the attached Cup logo&lt;br /&gt;
- We have a video that we can provide to replace the highlights/ads section&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We would need no sound on this file, it would just be to recreate the animation and video portion. I&amp;#039;m not sure if it&amp;#039;s possible to just edit the source file or if the animation would need to be re-done. We are not opposed to a &amp;amp;quot;vintage&amp;amp;quot; VHS quality to the final product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 16, 2024 13:37 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Video Editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:Motion Graphics,     Video Editing
