I have a Youtube (YT) channel called The Mental Wellbeing Show in which I post &amp;#039;talking head&amp;#039;/interview style videos every week. Each episode is 45mins long and is a discussion about psychology with another researcher. I also post 4-5 Youtube Shorts/week https://www.youtube.com/@thementalwellbeingcollege &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To deliver a 45min edited video + 5 Shorts/wk, the budget is $60 USD (please note, this project is NOT a &amp;#039;paid-by-the-hour&amp;#039; project. You will be paid a flat fee of $60 USD for completion of each 45min video + 5 Shorts completed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*Upwork Job Requirements*&lt;br /&gt;
I am looking for a video editor to edit the weekly YT videos and the daily YT shorts. This includes:&lt;br /&gt;
 -Fixing sound issues (such as background noise)&lt;br /&gt;
-Making cuts between 3 tracks (my camera, guest camera and a &amp;#039;combined&amp;#039; camera) so there are interactive switches when we are talking&lt;br /&gt;
-Transitioning in an &amp;#039;ad break&amp;#039; and &amp;#039;show intro&amp;#039; before each main episode &lt;br /&gt;
-Creating 60sec Shorts from 2min footage that I give you each week&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To see the level of detail/quality required, please view some of the videos/Shorts my previous editor created (unfortunately, he has left the Team due to taking up a job in his community). These don&amp;#039;t have fancy animations, they just need to be good quality, error-free and meet my personal requirements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*What You Will Need To Apply*&lt;br /&gt;
-Able to speak English fluently. This is important so you understand what changes I request to be made for videos.&lt;br /&gt;
-Respond to messages within 48hrs&lt;br /&gt;
-Able to meet deadlines. I post videos at certain times of the week, so I need these returned and edited accordingly&lt;br /&gt;
-Good quality video editing&lt;br /&gt;
-Some video editing experience required (don&amp;#039;t need extensive experience)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

-Please confirm you speak fluent English and have edited videos before. Please include a portfolio/link to past work, if you have done past work&lt;br /&gt;

-Tell me 1 improvement you think could be made to the videos&lt;br /&gt;

Any questions, let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
