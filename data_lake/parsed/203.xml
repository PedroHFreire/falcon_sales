We are currently working on a short promo piece for the park that involves Santa&amp;#039;s elves bringing Christmas magic to the park. It culminates in them creating a Christmas tree made entirely out of sparkles and snow at night from a blizzard of snow. This is the part where we need VFX: to edit in this spiraling, shifting Christmas tree made of magic. The animation will consist of our two elves creating the sparkles, then those sparkles spiraling into the air to form the shape of a ~40ft Christmas tree in the center of a concrete pad. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Extra details: &lt;br /&gt;
- We have approximately seven video clips that involve VFX. It totals ~1 minute of raw footage. We&amp;#039;ll provide these clips for your reference in upwork messages. &lt;br /&gt;
- There is some camera movement in each of the clips: camera tracking would need to be used to give the illusion that the Christmas tree is in the center of the pad. &lt;br /&gt;
- Some of the clips have actual artificial snow that we used in the shot. The shots we took with a drone do not have this, and will need to have snow added in post. &lt;br /&gt;
- For the final drone shot, our lights are visible in-frame. We would like to have these keyed out or otherwise hidden by the animation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

- Sparkles creating Christmas tree vfx (very beginning of video): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=acccAGWMtHU&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Timeline: the finished video sequence would need to be completed within 2 weeks of contract start date. We would like be able to give creative input and see progress milestones along the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Questions to answer before contract acceptance:&lt;br /&gt;
- How many hours do you estimate this project would take? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirement: this needs to be created by you, not AI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are excited to get started on this project soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $700
