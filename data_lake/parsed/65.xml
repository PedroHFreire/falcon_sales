Job description:&lt;br /&gt;
Hi, I need someone to create a video tutorial on ComfyUI. What it is and detailed overview with examples of how to use it, how to know what components to use etc so that an absolute beginner can go from having no idea to being able to confidently use ComfyUI,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Step 1: Send me the video script for the tutorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Step 2: I will provide any needed feedback for you to make edits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Step 3: I will get a voice over recorded based on your script. I will send you the voiceover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Step 4: You will create the tutorial by recording your screen and using the voice over I sent you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
- The video needs to be 1080p or 4k.&lt;br /&gt;
- No fancy editing.&lt;br /&gt;
- Just a recording of the screen. It needs to be a clean and clear tutorial without showing lots of icons, files, folders that don&amp;#039;t have anything to do with the tutorial or the taskbar.&lt;br /&gt;
- No highlighting around the cursor.&lt;br /&gt;
- No music, no other audio apart from the voice over I send you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please let me know:&lt;br /&gt;
- Your quote.&lt;br /&gt;
- How long this will take you to complete.&lt;br /&gt;
- Examples of other work you have done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you and looking forward to working with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 16, 2024 06:46 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: AI Image Generation &amp;amp; Editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:AI Image Generation,     Stable Diffusion,     Explainer Video,     Video Editing
