We are looking for a skilled video editor who can create shorts everyday for our brands. Basically Fcebook ads. (videos take max 20 min to make)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will give raw footage and you do your magic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some examples:&lt;br /&gt;

https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8pOAVnMXQc/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;amp;amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The hard part is not the editing as you see. Of course you need to have skills but the most important part is to make the video captivating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You need to do researches on which fonts to use best for fashion niches, which music is now trending and &amp;amp;quot;girly&amp;amp;quot;. You need to go on tiktok/instagram and search for fashion brands by yourself for inspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Add captions with emojis and stuff, as the first video linked above&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a BAD example: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1930vZgOueh7hVERuXHFuE6UOwGNBjCAM/view?usp=drive_link&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need the music to have ups and downs, beats , example see beat at 13s and notice how the music began low (trendy music btw):&lt;br /&gt;
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qf3TRHrds17nv6dCkiKFge1mtQ8k9kb7/view?usp=drive_link&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;#039;re ready to pop up 1 video with some variations a day (Monday to friday) and be paid 100$/month, it would be awesome and glad to have you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Send please your porfolio. Write &amp;amp;quot;fashion&amp;amp;quot; at the beginning so I know you read all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $100

1. Video Podcast&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This podcast has already had several episodes recorded and edited in a particular style, so we have the Premier Pro files for you to use for ease. &lt;br /&gt;
We record with 3 cameras - one on each guest and then a wide angle, and we have professional microphones to capture each speaker, as well as the microphone audio feeding in the main wide lens camera. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Each episode is 40-60mins long. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are the requirements for each episode:&lt;br /&gt;
- Combine all the files and cut out all the unnecessary parts&lt;br /&gt;
- Make natural cuts throughout the video so that it makes for nice viewing&lt;br /&gt;
- Colour grade so it matches our previous episodes &lt;br /&gt;
- Clean out the audio so it&amp;#039;s also studio quality like our previous episodes&lt;br /&gt;
- Create the trailer and pop it at the beginning of the video as well as exporting as a separate file&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;#039;d also love the ideal person to create additional clips for us and even upload and manage our YouTube. But we can quote for that separately. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We release an episode every single week and so we&amp;#039;d really like someone to give us a fixed price per episode or even a bulk rate for 5, 10 or 20 episodes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2. YouTube video editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will be releasing a minimum of 3 videos per week on YouTube and we are looking for someone who is very quick with this due to the high volume. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This won&amp;#039;t be complicated as we will have just one camera and the videos will be between 5-15 mins long. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However, these will require more B-roll to be added in, some graphics to be on the screen and generally we&amp;#039;d love someone who has experience in helping YouTubers grow their channel so they can help manage this too. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
IDEAL CANDIDATE&lt;br /&gt;
The ideal candidate is someone who is proficient in Premiere Pro and other new AI editing tools so that we can speed up the process and create some cool stuff. &lt;br /&gt;
They are also passionate about video and have experience with YouTube and want to take more responsibility to manage things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
They&amp;#039;d bring creative ideas to the table and be very much part of the team. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking for a long-term commitment and someone who can actually dedicate several hours a week, rather than miss deadlines and disrupt our workflow. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So, please only apply if you have time to dedicate per week. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Would love to get a quote for the podcast episode editing and the 3x videos per week for the YouTube channel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 26, 2024 20:21 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Video Editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:Color Grading,     Footage-Based Video,     Spokesperson Video,     Adobe Premiere Pro,     Video Editing,     Video Post-Editing,     Video Production,     Adobe After Effects,     Videography

We are looking for a skilled video editor who can create shorts everyday for our brands. Basically Fcebook ads. (videos take max 20 min to make)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will give raw footage and you do your magic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some examples:&lt;br /&gt;

The hard part is not the editing as you see. Of course you need to have skills but the most important part is to make the video captivating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You need to do researches on which fonts to use best for fashion niches, which music is now trending and &amp;amp;quot;girly&amp;amp;quot;. You need to go on tiktok/instagram and search for fashion brands by yourself for inspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Add captions with emojis and stuff, as the first video linked above&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a BAD example: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1930vZgOueh7hVERuXHFuE6UOwGNBjCAM/view?usp=drive_link&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need the music to have ups and downs, beats , example see beat at 13s and notice how the music began low (trendy music btw):&lt;br /&gt;
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qf3TRHrds17nv6dCkiKFge1mtQ8k9kb7/view?usp=drive_link&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;#039;re ready to pop up 1 video with some variations a day (Monday to friday) and be paid 100$/month, it would be awesome and glad to have you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Send please your porfolio. Write &amp;amp;quot;fashion&amp;amp;quot; at the beginning so I know you read all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $100
