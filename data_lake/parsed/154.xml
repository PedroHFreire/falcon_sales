The required video is a to be a video showcasing a section of a website that spans about 15 seconds. The video is to be a scrolling screen capture of the website shown in a 1500x1080 viewport where it will take 7 seconds to scroll through the first 2 sections of the website until it reaches the video- at which point I want the video to the actual video file that is on the website and play for another 5-10 seconds. We want this transition to be smooth - I have some ideas on how I want it to look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It is to be used as an asset we are preparing for our site as a portfolio piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Need fast delivery - we are looking for someone who can swiftly handle this short project and complete by Thursday, June 20th.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $250
