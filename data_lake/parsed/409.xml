We have done a world record for the longest table tennis rally which you can see here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s_ZWerSL8k &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We want to have a number counter in the top right hand corner to represent each time we hit the ball. An example of this is in this video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEhNQE786LA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have the full file on a wetransfer link its 13 hours long. Is this something you can produce using an AI tool? The counter could go up using the sound bites when the ball has been hit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;
