This is a serious hire for us so please read and understand this entire post prior to submitting an application. We won&amp;#039;t be able to reply to generic copy/paste inquiries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
About us:&lt;br /&gt;
Prince Armory is a high end custom costume/armor/props service with an online academy and moderate social following (300K+).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You can preview some of our videos at www.youtube.com/princearmory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Why we&amp;#039;re hiring:&lt;br /&gt;
Having worked with a number of part time freelance video editors, what we really need is someone who can learn our brand and make it their full time focus and directly help us mange our video content and YouTube channel and social following (300K+ currently).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The bulk of the work will be in editing, and intermediate level video editing skills are fine.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But we do need someone with some experience with YouTube specifically and general understanding of social media so we can increase the output of content.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
About the job:&lt;br /&gt;
You will be responsible for editing our primary videos, creating engaging shorts, and producing micro content for social media platforms. This role will also involve everything around the videos such as helping with thumbnails, tiles, and general managing our YouTube channels, optimizing descriptions, and tags, and engaging with the audience through comments and community posts. In order for me to properly offload this role as a full time position I will need someone who is willing to understand and execute the whole role from top to bottom. This also means collaborating with me on the planning stages of videos to know what&amp;#039;s in the pipeline as well as suggesting topics and alternate videos we can pull from content we already have planned. I have endless video footage available and on the way and I need someone to not just help make the videos, but to help leverage the video assets we&amp;#039;re making for productive benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Who is the best fit?&lt;br /&gt;
The ideal applicant for this role is someone who is looking for a long term position with a lot of room for creative expression. Our company is primarily artistic and creative and we always want to raise the bar in the presentation and quality of our content.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We are not looking for the perfect candidate, we just need someone with a few key skills and some experience and who is coachable and eager to learn our brand and help us be a part of building towards something big and exciting.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We hope to find someone who is self motivated, a generalist with a love of gaining new skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Budget:&lt;br /&gt;
Our budget will vary depending on a number of factors and is negotiable depending on both quantity and quality of content output. At first, we expect to test a few of the most promising applicants with some initial projects and making a long term hire according to the best fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Skills required:&lt;br /&gt;
- Proficiency in video editing software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro &lt;br /&gt;
- Strong knowledge of YouTube&amp;#039;s best practices and algorithms/audience retention&lt;br /&gt;
- Ability to create visually appealing and engaging content&lt;br /&gt;
- Excellent attention to detail and presentation of complex crafting tutorial topics&lt;br /&gt;
- Strong communication and collaboration abilities&lt;br /&gt;
- Flexibility &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Technical Details:&lt;br /&gt;
- Our video projects vary in size, we&amp;#039;ll need a lot of micro content in the 10-90s range, as well as many macro videos which will can be in the 7 to 12 minute range, some will be 30m to 1hr range.&lt;br /&gt;
- Some videos will be easy in the way of trimming down vlog style videos, some will be very complex tutorials with many camera angles and many hours of footage.&lt;br /&gt;
- We mostly shoot in 4K60 10bit with most bitrates being 100Mb/s+&lt;br /&gt;
- We shoot with up to 6 cameras. We do have time code in most instances.&lt;br /&gt;
- Projects will vary in size greatly and there will often be large shoots we will need to extract multiple videos from but expect some projects to range in the 2-3TB range.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Smaller vids can be 200-500GB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Experience Needed&lt;br /&gt;
- At minimum we will require some proven experience in video editing &lt;br /&gt;
- Some experience or at least understand of what it takes to manage and grow a YouTube channel or other social media platforms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Bonus points for :&lt;br /&gt;

</description><ns0:encoded>We are looking for a skilled and experienced full-time video editor and YouTube manager, ideally with some interest in arts, crafts, and fantasy genre. This is a serious hire for us so please read and understand this entire post prior to submitting an application. We won&amp;#039;t be able to reply to generic copy/paste inquiries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
About us:&lt;br /&gt;
Prince Armory is a high end custom costume/armor/props service with an online academy and moderate social following (300K+).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You can preview some of our videos at www.youtube.com/princearmory&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Why we&amp;#039;re hiring:&lt;br /&gt;
Having worked with a number of part time freelance video editors, what we really need is someone who can learn our brand and make it their full time focus and directly help us mange our video content and YouTube channel and social following (300K+ currently).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The bulk of the work will be in editing, and intermediate level video editing skills are fine.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;But we do need someone with some experience with YouTube specifically and general understanding of social media so we can increase the output of content.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
About the job:&lt;br /&gt;
You will be responsible for editing our primary videos, creating engaging shorts, and producing micro content for social media platforms. This role will also involve everything around the videos such as helping with thumbnails, tiles, and general managing our YouTube channels, optimizing descriptions, and tags, and engaging with the audience through comments and community posts. In order for me to properly offload this role as a full time position I will need someone who is willing to understand and execute the whole role from top to bottom. This also means collaborating with me on the planning stages of videos to know what&amp;#039;s in the pipeline as well as suggesting topics and alternate videos we can pull from content we already have planned. I have endless video footage available and on the way and I need someone to not just help make the videos, but to help leverage the video assets we&amp;#039;re making for productive benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Who is the best fit?&lt;br /&gt;
The ideal applicant for this role is someone who is looking for a long term position with a lot of room for creative expression. Our company is primarily artistic and creative and we always want to raise the bar in the presentation and quality of our content.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We are not looking for the perfect candidate, we just need someone with a few key skills and some experience and who is coachable and eager to learn our brand and help us be a part of building towards something big and exciting.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We hope to find someone who is self motivated, a generalist with a love of gaining new skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Budget:&lt;br /&gt;
Our budget will vary depending on a number of factors and is negotiable depending on both quantity and quality of content output. At first, we expect to test a few of the most promising applicants with some initial projects and making a long term hire according to the best fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Skills required:&lt;br /&gt;
- Proficiency in video editing software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro &lt;br /&gt;
- Strong knowledge of YouTube&amp;#039;s best practices and algorithms/audience retention&lt;br /&gt;
- Ability to create visually appealing and engaging content&lt;br /&gt;
- Excellent attention to detail and presentation of complex crafting tutorial topics&lt;br /&gt;
- Strong communication and collaboration abilities&lt;br /&gt;
- Flexibility &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Technical Details:&lt;br /&gt;
- Our video projects vary in size, we&amp;#039;ll need a lot of micro content in the 10-90s range, as well as many macro videos which will can be in the 7 to 12 minute range, some will be 30m to 1hr range.&lt;br /&gt;
- Some videos will be easy in the way of trimming down vlog style videos, some will be very complex tutorials with many camera angles and many hours of footage.&lt;br /&gt;
- We mostly shoot in 4K60 10bit with most bitrates being 100Mb/s+&lt;br /&gt;
- We shoot with up to 6 cameras. We do have time code in most instances.&lt;br /&gt;
- Projects will vary in size greatly and there will often be large shoots we will need to extract multiple videos from but expect some projects to range in the 2-3TB range.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Smaller vids can be 200-500GB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Experience Needed&lt;br /&gt;
- At minimum we will require some proven experience in video editing &lt;br /&gt;
- Some experience or at least understand of what it takes to manage and grow a YouTube channel or other social media platforms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Bonus points for :&lt;br /&gt;
- Marketing experience&lt;br /&gt;
- any existing knowledge or interest in leathercrafting or armor making&lt;br /&gt;
- at least one crafting or trade skill or physical material medium&lt;br /&gt;
- Animations/Effects, 3D effects, 3D modeling&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
