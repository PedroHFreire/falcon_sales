Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Proven experience in video shooting and editing.&lt;br /&gt;
We aren&amp;#039;t looking for someone with 75 years of experience.... &lt;br /&gt;
We want to work with people who come in ready to try new things.&lt;br /&gt;
Ability to produce high-energy, visually appealing content.&lt;br /&gt;
Quick adaptability and strong creative input.&lt;br /&gt;
Comfortable with fast-paced, improvisational work.&lt;br /&gt;

We are visiting Paris and will need:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
4-5 short videos produced (with still photos included)&lt;br /&gt;
2-3 photoshoots (branding and lifestyle)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Two different projects, but similar needs and styles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am a youtuber and vlogger who loves fashion, traveling and spirituality. My content is upbeat, informative, and artistic. I also write music and have music videos out - but main focus is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
+Video of me visiting Monet&amp;#039;s Garden in Giverny (adventure day!) &lt;br /&gt;
+Informative video of burlesque and the Moulin Rouge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
+BTS Video of art and creating time at our home. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
+Artist branding photoshoot&lt;br /&gt;
+Fashion/Friendship photoshoot&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My desire is to have the photos within a 5-7 days and the videos within 10-14 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am open to hiring one person for all of these if the creative chemistry and price is right!! I like quality content - doesn&amp;#039;t have to be longest videos 2-10 minutes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Photoshoots are always fun and easy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are staying somewhere near the Louvre. Some videos will take place onsite of the home, others will require travel (which I&amp;#039;ll pay your train expenses, etc)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please share your portfolio and website. I&amp;#039;ll share my whatsapp once I&amp;#039;ve received aligned invitations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All the Best!!&lt;br /&gt;
Eager to co-create and enjoy Paris. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you for your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
