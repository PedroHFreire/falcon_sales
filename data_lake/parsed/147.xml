We are looking for an experienced editor who is highly proficient in (and uses the latest version of) After Effects. This is ESSENTIAL. &lt;br /&gt;
The project is a combination of sourcing and editing footage AND understanding how to change editable parts of the AE compositions in order to create the final videos.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
All the AE elements are already build, are simple to operate and are provided for you. But you MUST have access to the latest versions of AE and a HIGH level of understanding and proficiency.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have these skills then the project will be a simple and quick process.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We currently produce 2 x 10 min videos per week. The role may be ongoing for the right candidate with the pay rate to be discussed.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We work via Trello and Slack for all communication and workflow, so experience of these would also be preferred. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $50

I&amp;#039;m Ivan, the creator behind Vanilla Investor, a platform dedicated to making personal finance and investing easy to understand. My YouTube channel (https://www.youtube.com/@vanillainvestor) has been growing steadily, and I post weekly videos every Sunday focused on investment strategies, financial planning, and wealth-building tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Balancing content creation with my full-time job in the finance field at a forex broker has become challenging, and I&amp;#039;m now looking for a talented VideoScribe editor to help bring my ideas to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here&amp;rsquo;s what I need:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- VideoScribe Expertise: I need someone who can transform scripts and voiceovers into engaging whiteboard animations using VideoScribe. Ideally, you should have a VideoScribe license, allowing you to use the template I provide and let me make any final adjustments if needed.&lt;br /&gt;
- Multimedia Integration: Beyond creating the whiteboard animation, it would be great if you could add sound effects and some B-roll to enhance the final video.&lt;br /&gt;
- File Handling: I will provide the script, voiceover, and stock images and videos for the animation. You&amp;rsquo;ll integrate these elements seamlessly to produce a polished final product.&lt;br /&gt;
- Editing &amp;amp;amp; Creativity: Your job will be to edit and animate the content into a cohesive final product that aligns with Vanilla Investor&amp;#039;s style and messaging.&lt;br /&gt;
- Collaboration: I&amp;rsquo;m looking for someone interested in building a long-term working relationship. Ideally, we can work together to regularly produce 1 video per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Is this something you&amp;#039;re interested in for a long-term partnership? If so, please take a look at my YouTube channel for an idea of my current content and style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Looking forward to your response and hopefully to working together!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Hey, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m looking for someone that is amazing at creating high quality Reels for my hotel. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The content provided will be mostly still images with some video but I need the Reel Templates to cater to using still images. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am looking to hire ASAP once I found the perfect person. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Looking forward to speak to you! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
