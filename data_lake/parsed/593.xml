See 5 July in the Agenda section here https://indiaweek.uk/ and the Agenda section here https://indiaweek.uk/film for the session backgrounds we need to create. This is how the screen looked last year: https://www.economicpolicygroup.com/india-week-ideas-for-india-2023/.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Screen size/style. 11.5M By 3M, 2944 x 768pixel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Based on brand assets provided, I need:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
5 July: &lt;br /&gt;
 - An intro animation using the animation you can see at the top of the website link above + sponsor logos&amp;#039; animation&lt;br /&gt;
 - For each of the sessions, one background which has Session Title and maybe Speaker Names (not sure yet). About 6-7 of these&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
6 July:&lt;br /&gt;
 - Same intro animation as the day before, but with different sponsor logos&amp;#039; animation&lt;br /&gt;
 - Same session background slide requirement, about 5-6 sessions&lt;br /&gt;
 - For the evening, we have a dinner where we need intro animation + sponsor logos animation, plus a few slides with names of speakers on the stage&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We can use similar branding on the background for each session, but maybe slightly different or different colour between 5th day, 5th day, 5th evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The brand collateral, content on each of the slides etc I have avialable and it should be extremely straightforward. The only complex thing&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;might be 1-2 logos might be low quality, but we can cross that bridge if we get to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Last year, with someone similar to you in terms of experience and pricing, I paid $500, but I think that was an overestimate (so I was a little unhappy), because he finished it very quickly. The only thing that took time is the rendering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I would need it delivered by Tuesday evening if possible. I will quickly review it then and sign off - last year we needed only one iteration because of some spelling mistakes, but the graphics were perfectly fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 27, 2024 13:56 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Motion Graphics&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:Motion Graphics,     Adobe After Effects,     Adobe Premiere Pro,     Logo Animation,     DaVinci Resolve,     Video Editing,     Color Grading,     Animation,     Motion Design,     Explainer Video,     Videography,     Video Production,     3D Modeling,     3D Design,     Visual Effects

I am looking for someone to help me make these 8 sound better before the launch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
