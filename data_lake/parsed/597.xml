We are looking for a top notch video editor who can turn our raw video clips into high converting video ads, to be used on Meta Ads (Facebook &amp;amp;amp; Instagram), TikTok Ads, YouTube Shorts and more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
- Must be confident with different styles of videos, including UGC, voiceovers, compilations etc.&lt;br /&gt;
- Must speak English to a native level and have great copywriting skills.&lt;br /&gt;
- Must understand how to edit videos targeted towards a FEMALE audience, especially a US-based audience of different age ranges.&lt;br /&gt;
- Must understand what goes into a high converting video ad - especially in terms of hooks, video structure, and other things like &amp;#039;engagement baiting&amp;#039; / creating controversy.&lt;br /&gt;
- Must be able to think outside the box and test different approaches (eg. voiceover vs music vs natural background sound).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Extras (not required):&lt;br /&gt;
- Able to create their own voiceovers for video ads (female only!)&lt;br /&gt;
- Have experience shooting UGC content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our brand sells handmade bags and accessories, and our customers love our products! We&amp;#039;d love to work with an enthusiastic individual who loves our products as much as we do, and wants to make the most of their creativity to help elevate the brand to the next level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have hundreds of raw video clips waiting to be turned into highly engaging social media content, so the possibilities are endless... Plus we can shoot more at any time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you think you&amp;#039;re the right fit for the job, please get in contact - we&amp;#039;d love to hear from you! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 27, 2024 15:15 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Video Editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:Testimonial Video,     Video Editing,     Social Media Marketing,     UGC
