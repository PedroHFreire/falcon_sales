I own a private label on Amazon and selling plant-based protein powders &amp;ndash; pouches and sachets. I am looking to hire individuals who will make HIGH quality UGC videos for my products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I am preparing to undertake some email outreach and paid advertising and wish to establish an online presence before I do so, and therefore want to have some content on my channels prior to undertaking any sales strategies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m currently putting together a content plan to publish on my Instagram and Facebook profiles, with the view to extending this to YouTube and TikTok as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So, I&amp;rsquo;m looking for someone who has great skills in using design applications and platforms such as Photoshop, Premiere Pro, Capcut and Canva to create a batch of content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Once you&amp;#039;ve created the content you&amp;#039;ll be scheduling it for publication to these channels using your preferred social media management application / platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the content will be video so you will ideally have good video editing skills, and will need to be able to work with multiple visual and audio assets such as video, image and graphic files, and voice over recordings. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will need to have an understanding of the optimum pixel resolution and aspect ratio guidelines that are currently standard for posting content on Facebook and Instagram, such as 16:9, 9:16, 5:4 and 1x1, and which scenario each aspect ratio is relevant. E.g. 5:4 sized images are cropped to square format on the FB feed, but 5:4 sized videos aren&amp;rsquo;t. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When it comes to creating content, you don&amp;rsquo;t need to be a fully qualified graphic designer, but it would be great if you have somewhat of an &amp;lsquo;eye&amp;rsquo; for design, and not just be someone who can simply use the Canva platform. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll also be conceptualising new and fresh content ideas and using your understanding and knowledge of current trends to create engaging click worthy content. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The hours will be ad hoc to start with, but if the partnership works well there may be an opportunity to become my social media manager. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $5.00

Each video describes a Chinese character and is roughly 1-2 min long. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All assets and materials will be provided as well as a completed video to use as a template. It&amp;#039;s not tricky editing, it&amp;#039;s quite straightforward but it does require attention to detail and consistency. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need these videos completed by the end of June/early July so please be aware of this tight turnaround time when applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We estimate each video will take half an hour to edit and the other half hour would be used for one revision and anything extra resulting in a total of one hour spent on one character/video,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In total we are estimating about 55 hours of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
