What we are doing:&lt;br /&gt;
We are an online education company and we create educational tutorial videos on YouTube about online problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
- Decent microphone&lt;br /&gt;
- Screen recording software (OBS)&lt;br /&gt;
- Proficiency in english&lt;br /&gt;
- Bonus: voice over experience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tasks:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Video creation&lt;br /&gt;
You will be recording video tutorials to online problems. Topics about online games and mobile apps are most common. (e.g. &amp;amp;quot;How To Copy And Paste on Bluestacks&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;How To Change Emotes in Brawl Stars&amp;amp;quot;, &amp;amp;quot;How To Make GIF Stickers on Whatsapp iPhone&amp;amp;quot;).&lt;br /&gt;
Most videos are typically between 1-3 minutes long, can be recorded in one go and therefore don&amp;#039;t require any editing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Note: In the beginning stages we will introduce you to our systems but after a while you will become more efficient, since you will get to know each step of the process and you&amp;#039;ll finish the tasks even quicker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Payment&lt;br /&gt;
The payment is per video. We are looking for dedicated freelancers that can provide 4-5 videos per day. (28-35 videos per week) Recording 5 videos takes around 30 minutes using our systems. The payment per video is $1.25, which equals to $35.00 (28 videos) - $43.75 (35 videos) per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Note: Videos don&amp;#039;t need to be recorded on a daily basis, you could finish all the work in the first 2 days of the week and be free for the rest of the week while still getting paid as agreed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Get started&lt;br /&gt;
If you are interested in working together, DM me a short video sample that includes your human voice over and we will take things from there! (video sample can be about anything: e.g. &amp;amp;quot;How to create a folder on pc&amp;amp;quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Best regards&lt;br /&gt;

I have been making a website with the aim of helping people who buy and sell antiques and vintage items.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;They can search my site for their item and see how much it has sold for previously. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The website is approaching the final stages and I want to start advertising it on social media (mainly instagram but I will be using youtube in the future a lot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have made a long video (3 mins) explaining the site - perhaps this could be optimised and just made a bit better with your technical skills!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My main focus with this post is to create some reels that highlight some of the profits that could be made when using my site. If you are also able to help me to gain more followers - helping with advertising and reaching the right people that is a very welcome bonus. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The ideal candidate will be very patient with me whilst I try to explain the visions in my head to you! Ideally you would have some knowledge of buying and selling antiques or something transferable &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for your time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
www.thehammerpricex.com &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
p.s my idea for the reels is to show pictures of items bought for one price and then what it sold for.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This will showcase quite large profits that can be made, but how we capture the audience&amp;#039;s attention based on a couple of pictures is where I need you! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $100
