And are producing a simple video for each one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;#039;re not having anything custom produced but instead using this AI tool which does 95% of the heavy lifting: www.oxolo.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That tool still needs a bit of video editing after the AI has done the first draft, for choosing the right images, voice over, text etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;#039;re a video editor and have used that tool then great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Or if not and you&amp;#039;re an editor please bid if you&amp;#039;re happy / comfortable using such a tool&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $15.00-$30.00

We have an E-commerce Advertising Agency and we&amp;rsquo;re looking for a video editor for short TikTok videos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
AT FIRST, WE NEED ONLY ONE TIKTOK VIDEO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

In the case of a long-term partnership, we will need around 15 videos/week. &lt;br /&gt;
Here are some examples of what we need:&lt;br /&gt;

Usually, these VSLs are around 5-10 minutes long and are made mostly from stock footage and UGC content of our product created in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the time, we are rewriting scripts of other successful VSLs and updating them to fit our product. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

So basically, you are re-creating working VSLs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally, you will be updating VSLs we already created with new angles or hooks so we can continue testing new VSLs with ads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking for a person who is smart, has common sense, and is willing to spend time learning about our products, the problems they solve, the benefits they offer customers, and to deeply understand our customers&amp;#039; minds. This way, every piece of footage you pick will resonate with the customer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will provide you with all UGC content, stock footage, and examples of VSLs that worked in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We run a custom apparel business that focuses on selling apparel to our partner school&amp;#039;s fans. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are launching our Fall Football Fundraiser and need a quick explainer animation video to help explain the process.&lt;br /&gt;
We will host an online store with a custom hat for a football team and sell to their fans and pay them the profits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are doing a wide campaign to new schools to participate and need a video to help quickly summarize the process. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Video will be approx 30-45 seconds&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Script will be provided. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I think a simple whiteboard animation will be good, but open to other ideas. Some of the 2d standard explainer videos seem kind of cheap. But again - open to your creative suggestions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please include references to something similar (if available) - either apparel sales, apparel production, team sports, etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
