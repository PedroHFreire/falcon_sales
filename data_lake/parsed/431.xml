I am looking to partner with a freelancer to edit recordings and VODS into shorter entertaining videos for YouTube. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The recording I was wanting to begin with is 2hrs in length, which is the typical length for our VODS, and I was hoping to have the youtube video be around 15mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I understand a number of people will have the essential skills with editing such as colour grading, motion graphics, subtitles ect. but we are also looking for someone who has a good sense of when moments are funny and how to bring out the comedic value of a moment with their editing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have set the job posting to hourly pay however I usually prefer to work on a fixed price basis. If you could also include a rough quote for which options works best for you that would be hugely appreciated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We plan to do some test runs with a few of the top candidates so if you could include some of your previous work as reference that would be incredibly helpful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have attached below 3 different youtube videos as examples from 3 different milestones of subscribers, that we would like to model after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have any questions or require further information please don&amp;#039;t hesitate to reach out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for your time.&lt;br /&gt;
Kind regards,&lt;br /&gt;
Lachlan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

</description><ns0:encoded>Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am looking to partner with a freelancer to edit recordings and VODS into shorter entertaining videos for YouTube. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The recording I was wanting to begin with is 2hrs in length, which is the typical length for our VODS, and I was hoping to have the youtube video be around 15mins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I understand a number of people will have the essential skills with editing such as colour grading, motion graphics, subtitles ect. but we are also looking for someone who has a good sense of when moments are funny and how to bring out the comedic value of a moment with their editing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have set the job posting to hourly pay however I usually prefer to work on a fixed price basis. If you could also include a rough quote for which options works best for you that would be hugely appreciated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We plan to do some test runs with a few of the top candidates so if you could include some of your previous work as reference that would be incredibly helpful. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have attached below 3 different youtube videos as examples from 3 different milestones of subscribers, that we would like to model after.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have any questions or require further information please don&amp;#039;t hesitate to reach out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for your time.&lt;br /&gt;
Kind regards,&lt;br /&gt;
Lachlan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
