I just need some objects cut out and given slight swaying motion graphics. Nothing dramatic. Just give it some front, middle, back objects for depth. 2 cut outs in the front, 2 in the middle, 2 in the back. With some overlapping for slight depth of image. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The cut out objects size can be increased and movement sway added, just moving very slightly like 10 degrees or so. This way the empty space behind cannot be seen. The goal is to make the image non static looking. Not so much intense animation, but a vague movement and slight depth. Very simplistic. Need the images edited as fast as possible. Doesn&amp;#039;t matter which part of the images are cut out. I just don&amp;#039;t want the image to look static and flat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
