I&amp;#039;m the owner of a fragrance company, and want to making Instagram a consistent part of my marketing efforts. I&amp;#039;ve been limping along on my own, but could really use an extra set of hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I take plenty of footage, but I don&amp;#039;t have the time to cut it together into attention-getting visuals. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That&amp;#039;s where you come in! I already have a process mapped out in my head, so I know where I desperately need your help:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. I need a&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;video editor to create awesome Instagram reels&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;by taking my raw footage and turn it into visually stunning and attention-grabbing short videos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2. I usually map out product focus/themes and record around those. I can upload them into folders that way so you know exactly where to pull from, and I have a content theme calendar so you&amp;#039;ll know what to focus on for a given week&amp;#039;s content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3. I don&amp;#039;t necessarily need someone to write the captions since those tend to be in my own voice and that part comes easily. The video editing is just a killer on time for me, and I totally know i am NOT the best person to be doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
4. Something that&amp;#039;s important here is my brand has a pretty distinct voice - you must be able to capture cheeky humor and the high-end quality of my products. I&amp;#039;ll make sure you have the footage to do that, but I need your talent in translating it to the visual output!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The perfect candidate will understand Instagram&amp;#039;s reel format and trends, and be able to edit multiple videos together seamlessly. I am all about repurposing content as much as possible to save time. I also have CapCut Pro, if that&amp;#039;s helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Responsibilities:&lt;br /&gt;
- Edit and organize video footage to make engaging Instagram reels&lt;br /&gt;
- Add cool effects, transitions, and music to enhance the videos&lt;br /&gt;
- Make sure the final videos meet the brand guidelines and quality standards&lt;br /&gt;
- Work with me to understand the message and target audience - I am here anytime to answer questions or help make decisions if you&amp;#039;re stuck among a few ideas!&lt;br /&gt;
- Deliver the edited videos on time&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Skills:&lt;br /&gt;
- Proficient in video editing software&lt;br /&gt;
- Knowledgeable about Instagram&amp;#039;s reel format and trends&lt;br /&gt;
- Can work under tight deadlines and deliver high-quality results&lt;br /&gt;
- Pays attention to detail and has excellent communication skills&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $10.00-$25.00
