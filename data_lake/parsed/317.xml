The audio is fully mastered and mixed ready to be used. video length is 3:20 and I would love to discuss concept and direction of the video with the videographer/editing/ producer. I will share what I have in a google drive and will need to have a short meeting to make sure we are aligned with the direction I want to have and express my goals for final results.

</description><ns0:encoded>I have YouTube videos that need to be captioned. You must have the software to return an SRT file. Not only do the files need captions but they also must have correct English, spelling, and grammar.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;This pays $0.70 per audio minute, so for 10 minutes of video, you get $7. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;
