The ideal candidate will have access to a range of products, particularly in categories such as kitchen appliances/tools, vacuums, kids toys, yard equipment, recreation equipment, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Responsibilities:&lt;br /&gt;
-Create high-quality faceless video reviews of Amazon products, ranging from 1 to 3 minutes in length.&lt;br /&gt;
-Ensure that the video showcases the product features and provides a clear understanding of how to use it.&lt;br /&gt;
-Familiarize yourself with the product details by reviewing Amazon product highlights and descriptions.&lt;br /&gt;
-Maintain excellent video quality to enhance the overall viewing experience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Each product featured should have a value of more than $25 on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;
2. No food, clothing, medicines, or beauty products.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Submit the amazon link to the product along with the video review&lt;br /&gt;
3. Commitment to delivering high-quality video content&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The audio does not need to be perfect in the video as it&amp;#039;s going to be extracted and voiced-over.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However, you will still need to speak so we can follow a timeline and your guide to do the voiceover of the product features/how to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking for 20 videos -$3 a video. These are faceless reviews with the audio voiced-over, so they shouldn&amp;#039;t take long to complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $60
