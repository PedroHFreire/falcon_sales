We have raw footage from several different camera angles that you will need to combine in an interested way for sessions that total 20 to 60 minutes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will also have access to the Powerpoint presentations, and in each session, you should switch between camera angles, zoom-in shots (where you zoom into an existing piece of footage to make it look like yet another camera angle that is zoomed in), b-roll from the event which we&amp;#039;ll provide and the presentation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This needs to be done in a professional way that keeps things visually interesting for the audience to watch. You should have some experience with this type of editing and be able to make calls on these types of post-production decisions without much direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All assets you create and all files, including source files, must be stored on our shared drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You need to sign an NDA for this job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You need to be able to deliver the first session by 5pm CST, June 17. This project is heavily time-sensitive and we need to work fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You are a great candidate for this opportunity if:&lt;br /&gt;
1 - You are at an intermediate or better level of skill in Pr and have put together b2b videos for companies before.&lt;br /&gt;
2 - You respond quickly, we expect deliverable turnarounds every 12-24 hours during business days.&lt;br /&gt;
3 - You are creative and cooperative and speak good English&lt;br /&gt;
4 - You are comfortable coordinating through Upwork messenger, Gmail and shared drives - we would only have a meeting if we get stuck and need to collaborate to keep things moving&lt;br /&gt;
5 - You have experience with working with professional organizations and doing professional-level work. Even better if you have worked with software / SaaS / tech companies before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is one of many projects we anticipate having in the near future. If we could find someone that is fast, high-quality and great to work with, we will plan to continue to use that person&amp;#039;s services.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Happy to share more details and answer any questions once we start the project. Looking forward to working with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
*You may NOT use this work in your portfolio or share with any other party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $5.00-$10.00

I&amp;#039;m looking for a video editor to us out on Tiktok&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have a team for 30+ freelancers working on automated Youtube channels. Right now I am looking for someone to work close with me in creating a really viral channel around faceless channel business tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will post on Titkok/YT Shorts. You need to have pretty high level of video editing skills. I prefer if you edit in after effects to get everything smooth like butter with transitions and effects!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This can become a good high paying opportunity, right now I am testing the waters but I am looking for a savage to be my person to go along on this mission&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
