The videos need to be in square and reel formats and created using specific exiting canva templates. The ability to work quickly and efficiently is a must. Attention to detail and fluent English skills are also important. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are examples of the finished video: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MSc5uNU0gdRxtHyINk9EfkGbhX1UkS9f?usp=sharing &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will create testimonial videos based on the examples and the templates provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I will provide: &lt;br /&gt;
- Name of person giving the testimonial (need to put on every slide)&lt;br /&gt;
- Profile image of the person giving testimonial (need to put on every slide)&lt;br /&gt;
- Text for the different slides; note the first slide serves as a &amp;ldquo;thumbnail&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
- Audio file with the spoken testimonial&lt;br /&gt;
- Outro to keep at end of the testimonial (is already inside the canva template)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Your task is to put it all together in canva and adjust the timing of each slide so it syncs up with the audio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I offer to pay $2 per video testimonial (square and reel). So this would be $16 for 8 videos (square and reel) I need for now.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Does that work for you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If we work well together, I have more work like this on an ongoing basis. (Need to create ~3-4 video testimonials per month). Also, you could take over other parts of the testimonial video making process, like creating the AI audio files and choosing the text for the video testimonials (needs good English skills)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you take on more tasks in the video testimonial creating process I would pay you more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 If you have the skills and expertise we are looking for, we would love to hear from you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please mention the word &amp;#039;canva&amp;#039; in the beginning of your proposal to show that you have read through this entire job post and understood the task.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;

</description><ns0:encoded>We are looking for a skilled Video Testimonial Creator to help us produce short video testimonials for use on various social media platforms using the platform Canva.com. The videos need to be in square and reel formats and created using specific exiting canva templates. The ability to work quickly and efficiently is a must. Attention to detail and fluent English skills are also important. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are examples of the finished video: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MSc5uNU0gdRxtHyINk9EfkGbhX1UkS9f?usp=sharing &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will create testimonial videos based on the examples and the templates provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I will provide: &lt;br /&gt;
- Name of person giving the testimonial (need to put on every slide)&lt;br /&gt;
- Profile image of the person giving testimonial (need to put on every slide)&lt;br /&gt;
- Text for the different slides; note the first slide serves as a &amp;ldquo;thumbnail&amp;rdquo;&lt;br /&gt;
- Audio file with the spoken testimonial&lt;br /&gt;
- Outro to keep at end of the testimonial (is already inside the canva template)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Your task is to put it all together in canva and adjust the timing of each slide so it syncs up with the audio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I offer to pay $2 per video testimonial (square and reel). So this would be $16 for 8 videos (square and reel) I need for now.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Does that work for you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If we work well together, I have more work like this on an ongoing basis. (Need to create ~3-4 video testimonials per month). Also, you could take over other parts of the testimonial video making process, like creating the AI audio files and choosing the text for the video testimonials (needs good English skills)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you take on more tasks in the video testimonial creating process I would pay you more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 If you have the skills and expertise we are looking for, we would love to hear from you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
