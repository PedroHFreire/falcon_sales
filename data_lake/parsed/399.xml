Want to hire Utubers who have their own channel of thousands, and who know how to launch a Utube video for quantities of counted views, monetization, (+social media, etc.), and/or talk to someone who knows how to place the video with firm(s) that have a channel for prompt connecting of the video to others. You will work on your own remotely, and share ideas with a team online, and can start now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The video is entertaining, and we need to verbally describe some thoughts, so you must have good communication in English, and be on top of deadlines and moving to the next steps quickly.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The video is edited and if you have editing skills and knowledge of effects, to further enhance it, that is fine.&lt;br /&gt;
