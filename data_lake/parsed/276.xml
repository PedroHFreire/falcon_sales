There are&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 objectives with this next job. The first objective is to create an animation with our logo to open and close all the videos we will be making moving forward. I&amp;rsquo;m not looking for anything too flashy. In the link below, I like the intro that our previous editor created. Check it out:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y43LttiCNZQ&amp;amp;amp;t=21s&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps provide us with a few examples for the open and close of a video to choose from. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The second object is to polish the 2 &amp;ldquo;Get a Quote&amp;rdquo; videos. Mostly&amp;hellip;add some music, intros and overlay the venue images when the girls name the locations: &amp;ldquo;All the Walter&amp;rsquo;s Estate Locations&amp;rdquo; ect&amp;hellip; (The filenames tell you the venue name.) One of the videos is greenscreen and needs to be keyed to white. (Possibly we may want a studio in the background. I&amp;rsquo;ll make that decision after I see the white.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m still waiting on the second video, but if you want to get going on the video you already have&amp;hellip;go for it. Here is the folder containing the venue images: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zkEZTgPtHFYk6klfK2PHDmZYOeZi_qjG?usp=sharing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 20, 2024 18:27 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Video Editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:Video Editing
