I need the help of someone who can record their rabbit while the rabbit is making sounds (purring, honking, oinking). It should include both audio and video.&lt;br /&gt;
Basically, I need you to record all the four seconds in the video below:&lt;br /&gt;

If you&amp;#039;re interested, please attach a picture of your rabbit. &lt;br /&gt;
Note: The difficulty of this project is that rabbits don&amp;#039;t make much sound. So you should wait until they make the sounds and have the camera ready to record them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
