Hope you have an amzing day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m looking for a video creator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you meet the requirements below you might be a good fit :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- You can do both video editing and voice over for &amp;amp;quot;how to&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;review&amp;amp;quot; videos. It is very bacic editing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- You have a british or american english accent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- You are willing to record your face and you have no problem being shown in our thumbnails with a picture of yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- You have enough knowledge about computers and apps related topics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Experience in this field is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you read this, please mention your favorite animal at the top of your aplication.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the beginning the videos will be 1-5 minutes long and we pay you $5 per video.&lt;br /&gt;
If you do 1 video per day , that will make you at least $150 per month.&lt;br /&gt;
In the future we also want to add some longer indepth tutorial videos that will pay more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is an example channel:https://www.youtube.com/@GuideRealmVideos&lt;br /&gt;
The only difference is that we also record our face to get more engagement with the viewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Our style is natural and fun. We provide clients with two videos. A full video and highlights. The videos include lots of fun shots of the guests, not too cheesy. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Highlights. 3-4 minutes (one song) usually with some natural sound coming through&amp;nbsp;including from the ceremony. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Full film, length&amp;nbsp;usually 45 minutes to an hour with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Arrival Montage (1 song)&lt;br /&gt;
- Ceremony in full edited between 2/3 cameras (two static) and external mics and sound selected from external mics.&lt;br /&gt;
- After Ceremony Montage (1-2 songs) &lt;br /&gt;
- Speeches in full edited between two cameras (one static) and sound selected from external mics.&lt;br /&gt;
- Evening Montage (half/1 song)&lt;br /&gt;
- First Dance and a few selects of other dancing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking&amp;nbsp;for nice natural cutting and a rough grade. We try to shoot colour and exposure as correctly in-camera as possible but may need some adjusting. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Editing in Adobe Premiere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We upload HD footage via OneDrive so you should have a fast enough internet connection to download large video files 80gb or so per project, this could take a few days depending on the speed of your connection but we can allow for this when setting the deadline for the edits. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please send examples of weddings you have edited. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The budget for each wedding is $150. Export and Adobe project file on delivery. Usually it&amp;#039;s two rounds of changes, one from us and one from the client. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are a friendly and professional company priding ourselves on producing great videos and building good working relationships with our freelancers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

My name is Josh Appel and I am a Real Estate Photographer and Videographer based in the United States. I photograph between 2-3 properties per week each needing anywhere between 10-40 images per property to be edited by a high quality photo editing professional. I also will shoot videos about once a week or so with each needing a high quality video editing professional. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What I am looking for in terms of editing requirements are:&lt;br /&gt;
- Sky replacement&lt;br /&gt;
- Fire to be added to fireplaces&lt;br /&gt;
- Images added to TV screens&lt;br /&gt;
- Colour correction&lt;br /&gt;
- Merge to HDR*** I only shoot bracketed photos with no flash so this is important!&lt;br /&gt;
- 24 hour turn around time on each photo job and 24-48 hour turn around time on each video job&lt;br /&gt;
- Walk through and drone video editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I shoot in RAW on a Sony A 7 IV camera and all my photos are bracketed. I can supply them to you via google photos link or if you have another way of file delivery, I am happy to look at the system you have in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am looking for someone reliable with good communication for a long term professional working relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have put together some sample images and videos in the google photos link below for you if you feel this job is a good fit for you. The link will include a drone photo, bracketed interior/exterior photos and multiple drone videos for you to complete a sample edit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
https://photos.app.goo.gl/zzvREcLSgUbTkG5p9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Looking forward to hearing from you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

</description><ns0:encoded>Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My name is Josh Appel and I am a Real Estate Photographer and Videographer based in the United States. I photograph between 2-3 properties per week each needing anywhere between 10-40 images per property to be edited by a high quality photo editing professional. I also will shoot videos about once a week or so with each needing a high quality video editing professional. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What I am looking for in terms of editing requirements are:&lt;br /&gt;
- Sky replacement&lt;br /&gt;
- Fire to be added to fireplaces&lt;br /&gt;
- Images added to TV screens&lt;br /&gt;
- Colour correction&lt;br /&gt;
- Merge to HDR*** I only shoot bracketed photos with no flash so this is important!&lt;br /&gt;
- 24 hour turn around time on each photo job and 24-48 hour turn around time on each video job&lt;br /&gt;
- Walk through and drone video editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I shoot in RAW on a Sony A 7 IV camera and all my photos are bracketed. I can supply them to you via google photos link or if you have another way of file delivery, I am happy to look at the system you have in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am looking for someone reliable with good communication for a long term professional working relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have put together some sample images and videos in the google photos link below for you if you feel this job is a good fit for you. The link will include a drone photo, bracketed interior/exterior photos and multiple drone videos for you to complete a sample edit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
https://photos.app.goo.gl/zzvREcLSgUbTkG5p9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Looking forward to hearing from you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
