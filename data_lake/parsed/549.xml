We need 12 social stories created from this project and the turnaround should be about 7-10 days. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We would like to see concepts of one first, with styling and music. Once the first is approved you can execute on the rest.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The idea is to create a cohesive series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
