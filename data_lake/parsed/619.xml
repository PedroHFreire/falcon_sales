I am seeking a video editor for a True Crime YouTube channel.&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m looking for a talented and reliable video editor to work with on a LONG TERM basis.&lt;br /&gt;
There will be consistent work, 2-3 videos a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Check out this channel to reference the style of video editing: https://www.youtube.com/@True0Crime&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
**I&amp;#039;m looking for intermediate level video editors as I don&amp;#039;t yet have the budget for pro video editors.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The scripts will range from 3,000-4,000 words and videos are generally between 18-29 minutes in duration.&lt;br /&gt;
The length of the video depends on how much clips will be in the video, of interrogations, police footage etc.&lt;br /&gt;
I will provide you with the script and voiceover for each video, and your job will be to include&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a mix of pictures related to the case and stock footages. I prefer the 80/20 rule when it comes to stock footage. No more than 20% of the video should be stock footage, 80% should be case photos, case videos etc. The only exception is if the case has very little photos and videos available online&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ideally, you will be someone who is interested in true crime content as that will translate through in your work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If this sounds like you, then please apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For budget I prefer we agree upon a fixed budget per video in the beginning, and not an hourly rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you for reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please say &amp;#039;chocolate&amp;#039; in your application so that I know you actually read this job description ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $25
