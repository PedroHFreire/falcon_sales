The footage has been shot, both the testimonial video, the B-ROLL, however; we need you to work in Tandem with our art director and create custom captions using our fonts and colours and using our trademarked 3D branded elements as the icons during the captions. It also needs to be colour graded to match the vibe of our company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I will be providing the script and voiceover, and need someone to pull relevant footage related to the script.

Please share some samples of YouTube channels you are currently working on &amp;amp;amp; UGC videos &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The topic of the channel will be obscure Wikipedia articles. The first video will be regarding the death of Mussolini. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini#Death&lt;br /&gt;
Some footage can be found on the wikipedia, however you will need to source more footage, and match the script to the video&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please only apply if you have experience making UGC content, and are not an agency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have read the entire post, please start your proposal with: &amp;amp;quot;I am not an agency&amp;amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* I will hire 3-4 freelancers to create a 1 minute sample video and based on that will chose who to hire for the channel * IF successful, this could become a long term relationship. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $4.00-$20.00
