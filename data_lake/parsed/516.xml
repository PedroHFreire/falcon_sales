You must own a car or a bike to drive around the city &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You must own you own gear and equipment like Camera, Lenses, Tripod, Microphone and Batteries&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will work 2 days a week per client, 3 hours each day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I will pay you $30usd an hour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And you will have 6 clients under your command &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That means that when you get to the point where you have the 6 clients under your command, you&amp;#039;ll be making $4,320/mo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In 6 months if you do your job properly, you can be eligible for a raise&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That means you will go from $4,320/mo to $6,000/mo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are going to be working initially with Kitchens Remodeling Companies, Bathroom Remodeling Companies and Construction Companies&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Your job is to go to the place they&amp;#039;re working and in the first 2 hours you and the client are going to film the &amp;amp;quot;A-Roll&amp;amp;quot; of the videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You have to film 50 clips for B-roll. 5 seconds each. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And the B-Roll you film must include camera movement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For example&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tracking&lt;br /&gt;
Lets say shots going from right to left&lt;br /&gt;
Following the workers doing the job over there&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And 2 or 3 styles more, Pretty easy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you don&amp;#039;t have experience, the minimum knowledge that you must have to qualify for this application is:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Know how a camera works&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
Know how to shoot videos in a camera&lt;br /&gt;
Know how to do camera movements &lt;br /&gt;
And have a car or bike to drive or ride around the city&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $4,320
