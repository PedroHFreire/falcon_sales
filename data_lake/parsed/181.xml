In the youtube channel video you have to show the recipe preparation of each page from beginning to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The book contains about 100 recipes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I pay $5 in TOTAL not per individual recipe, I know it is nothing but you gain free traffic and create content already that you need for your youtube channel since they come out about 100 videos (one per recipe) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
PLEASE ONLY PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DO THIS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The book then will be translated into 4 languages and published in 16 states&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $5

Job Description:&lt;br /&gt;
We wanted to share a project that our company is working on with Adobe, which involves crowdsourcing people for a video/audio AI project. It&amp;#039;s a fun project where all you must do is record yourself answering some questions and upload the videos to a Google Drive. This project involves you recording up to 10 videos of yourself on your phone and answering a few simple questions. It will take 20 - 30 minutes to complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please note that it may take 80 to 90 days to receive payment for&lt;br /&gt;
this job, after evaluation and approval of the videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As long as you use a modern phone with 4K video, follow the directions, record in 4K and 60 FPS, your video(s) should be approved and you will be paid for each video. As well, if your video is approved, you won&amp;rsquo;t have to submit more recordings. Your uploaded videos will be accepted as the final files, so submit up to 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose of this project is to provide training data for AI Voice models from real people in everyday settings. Your video and audio will not be used to create a clone or replication and will not be seen or heard by anyone outside of Voxpe or the client.&lt;br /&gt;
Watch this video for a quick walkthrough of how to record yourself with the correct specifications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Job Description:&lt;br /&gt;
We wanted to share a project that our company is working on with Adobe, which involves crowdsourcing people for a video/audio AI project. It&amp;#039;s a fun project where all you must do is record yourself answering some questions and upload the videos to a Google Drive. This project involves you recording up to 10 videos of yourself on your phone and answering a few simple questions. It will take 20 - 30 minutes to complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please note that it may take 80 to 90 days to receive payment for&lt;br /&gt;
this job, after evaluation and approval of the videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As long as you use a modern phone with 4K video, follow the directions, record in 4K and 60 FPS, your video(s) should be approved and you will be paid for each video. As well, if your video is approved, you won&amp;rsquo;t have to submit more recordings. Your uploaded videos will be accepted as the final files, so submit up to 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose of this project is to provide training data for AI Voice models from real people in everyday settings. Your video and audio will not be used to create a clone or replication and will not be seen or heard by anyone outside of Voxpe or the client.&lt;br /&gt;
Watch this video for a quick walkthrough of how to record yourself with the correct specifications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If any of your friends and family members would like to participate in this project just let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
