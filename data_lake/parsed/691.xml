I have 8 short clips which require elements of VFX and compositing. The main task will be to incorporate existing footage of Starling Bird Murmurations into the scenes from footage I have shot for the short film. I presume this will mean isolating the birds from the sample clips, placing them within the tracked main footage, and creating movement and blending so the compositing of the birds into the short film scenes looks seamless and as naturalistic as possible. There is also one drone shot which required a sky replacement, as well as adding the birds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The short film is a 10min passion project, created so far on zero budget with friends, but it explores complex themes relating to mental health, suicide and grief. I&amp;#039;d love to work with passionate and dedicated creatives to help take this project to the next level - and welcome people of all experience levels if you&amp;#039;re confident about the task. Despite the small budget, I hope this can prove a useful addition to your reels, and also a worthwhile creative project for you to contribute meaningfully to. Incorporating the birds into the film will play a crucial role in elevating it into a more symbolic and magical space - where the birds in some ways represent hope and the spirit of someone who is no-longer present. So I thank you for your consideration and interest in advance for taking on this really important task for a film I feel truly passionately about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am attaching a confidential review link to the full short film (WIP) here for your reference. This includes timecoded notes for the individual moments of VFX I have included in the GDrive below: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

And I am attaching a GDrive link to the 8 shots I have in mind that require birds composited in. More details can be shared on exactly what movement and birds I would like featured in each shot. But for now I have also added some sample clips in the GDrive folder of Starling bird murmurations I like and that we may be in a position to reuse for the compositing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

</description><ns0:encoded>Creating 8 Highly Realistic &amp;amp;amp; Naturalistic VFX / Compositing Shots for a Passion Project Short Film about Mental Health &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have 8 short clips which require elements of VFX and compositing. The main task will be to incorporate existing footage of Starling Bird Murmurations into the scenes from footage I have shot for the short film. I presume this will mean isolating the birds from the sample clips, placing them within the tracked main footage, and creating movement and blending so the compositing of the birds into the short film scenes looks seamless and as naturalistic as possible. There is also one drone shot which required a sky replacement, as well as adding the birds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
