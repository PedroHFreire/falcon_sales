We need a short (under 5 min) appx 175 word voiceover with backing track for a powerful/dramatic message to go along with a programmable LED bracelet visual display regarding the dawn of creation/light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
(see example of the LED bracelets at the link below)&lt;br /&gt;
The rough script is written - open to creative improvements (attached).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s meant to be VERY impactful.

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Concept: The audience of appx 1000 will be wearing interactive LED bracelets like these. Branded with our SHINE event logo.

The audio file will be played in the a large, pitch black theatre, with everyone in the crowd wearing an LED bracelet. &lt;br /&gt;
We will use them as a visual element to bring the story to life so that the listener is connected to the story and has a place in the narrative. The bracelets are programmable to each seat location and can be synced with the cues in the video to create and amplify the effects of the message.

The combined experience is meant to create a powerful experience/ display that interacts with the bracelets and creates a really impactful visual message.

Since the event&amp;#039;s theme is SHINE and lights are being used to convey this - The goal is to convey how God gave each of us a light. And, that light no matter how small or dim, it can make a difference to many when it shines. And that that light can grow, and spread and be shared and create essentially one small spark can create a blazing flame.&lt;br /&gt;
I like the idea of starting with the beginning of creation and how light was referenced in the Bible in the book of Genesis.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;There have been many videos created in the past which do a good job of creating an extremely powerful experience when the right, impactful audio and text is partnered with elements of light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Visual concept: 

The theatre will start in pitch black &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The audio will say &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ldquo;IN THE BEGINNING, THERE WAS LIGHT&amp;rdquo;

and along with that and just 1 bracelet in the centre of the crowd, will light up - dimly lit and pulsing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Then we will continue with the audio and corresponding visual bracelet programming to build the message.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Towards the end, when the bracelets are LL illuminated, we want to incorporate some or all of the event&amp;rsquo;s bible text theme:

You are the light of the world. 
A town built on a hill cannot be hidden. Neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl. 

Instead they put it on its stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house. 

In the same way, let your light shine before others, that they may see your good deeds and glorify your Father in heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Have a look at the script and keep in mind the concept and let me know if you&amp;#039;re a good fit to create impactful audio and provide creative ideas for this. Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I have several video segments that need editing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am looking for someone to complete the first two segments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For the first video (Edit1.mp4), the visible side needs to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;
I have outlined the area in a separate photo so you can see which part I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the second video (Edit2.mp4), something green is reflecting, with text and graphics on it.&lt;br /&gt;
These need to be edited so that only the green reflection remains in that area.&lt;br /&gt;
The goal is to make the advertisement unrecognizable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please only contact me if you are confident in your ability to complete these tasks with high quality.&lt;br /&gt;
If you have done very similar work before, you are welcome to send me the results so I can see your quality.&lt;br /&gt;
However, this is not mandatory. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please let me know your price expectations and the estimated time for completing these tasks after you have reviewed them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 19, 2024 20:17 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Video Editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:Video Editing

first video must be identical (with our watch instead..) of this one on this homepage:&lt;br /&gt;
https://laventure.swiss/en&lt;br /&gt;
We are not sure if the watch is real, a rendering or an hybrid...would be good to know.&lt;br /&gt;
Second video is more creative and infinity zooming will be the core of it.&lt;br /&gt;
We will have the final prototype of the watch in July but if we can do something already with a rendering, that would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $50.00-$130.00

</description><ns0:encoded>we need 2 videos for our watches website.&lt;br /&gt;
first video must be identical (with our watch instead..) of this one on this homepage:&lt;br /&gt;
https://laventure.swiss/en&lt;br /&gt;
We are not sure if the watch is real, a rendering or an hybrid...would be good to know.&lt;br /&gt;
Second video is more creative and infinity zooming will be the core of it.&lt;br /&gt;
