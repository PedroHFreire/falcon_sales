I have a video that needs editing in the next 24 hours or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My client is a fitness coach, and he has recorded a voiceover of him giving some fitness advice, and he&amp;#039;s also provided a bunch of b roll clips of my client working out etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;#039;re looking for an editor to take the voiceover, cut out any mistakes, gaps etc... and then put the engaging clips over the top and add engaging captions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The budget for this video is $6.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If this goes well, there&amp;#039;s likely to be similar work in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Will be hiring soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
