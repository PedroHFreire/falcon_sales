I&amp;#039;m Tiffany, the founder of frances marie (IG: @byfrancesmarie) a direct-to-consumer luxury perfume brand that uses mood enhancing ingredients to inspire Black women to feel more confident in being exactly who they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m gearing up for a Feb or March launch of my first scent and I&amp;#039;m in need of a really impactful Instagram Reel created for Valentine&amp;#039;s Day. I have the storyboard with the voice over attached to the job. I&amp;#039;m not married to how the current layout and welcome any suggestions. I&amp;#039;m a marketer by trade and have worked with a lot of video genius which I am not :) But I wanted to provide something so you&amp;#039;ll at least have a sense of what I&amp;#039;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;ve also included 4 stock videos that I plan to use. I have 10 in total but attaching 4 as examples. Please review and let me know your thoughts about the quality. I can also provide timestamps/clip durations that I&amp;#039;d like for each frame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now the fun part...budget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My budget is extremely tight, as I&amp;#039;m gearing up to launch. Who knew creating a perfume brand from scratch WITH custom, one of a kind scent would be so expensive. But anywho, because I am a marketer I am all about paying creatives what they&amp;#039;re worth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But take it easy on me *No Adele* because the budget is tight. And I&amp;#039;m willing to put in some work where I can. For example, selecting the part of each stock video files that I like and adding it to the storyboard. Just let me know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I feel like I&amp;#039;m rambling. Looking forward to connecting!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 22, 2024 19:33 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Video Editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:Instagram Reels,     Video Editing
