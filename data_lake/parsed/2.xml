https://www.youtube.com/@ChosenOnesOfficialYT/videos<br /><br />
The edits need to be in the same style as the videos in the channel above.<br /><br />
- Videos will be between 30-40 minutes long.<br />
- Ability to replicate the videos as shown on Chosen Ones, including subtitling from CapCut.<br />
- We need 3 VIDEOS per week, due Fridays.<br />
- We implement a -$10 penalty system for late submissions to ensure punctuality and hitting deadlines.<br /><br />
We&rsquo;re looking for someone with the following requirements:<br />
1. MUST have access to <br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- GPT-4 Subscription for AI Images<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- CapCut Subscription for Subtitling<br />
2. Fast response time.<br />
3. Good understanding of YouTube storytelling editing and retention.<br />
4. Respectful communication.<br /><br />
If this sounds like the job for you, you will be required to complete a sample:<br /><br />
Please download our latest video from our channel using a youtube downloader website, and re-edit the first minute.<br /><br />
1. Here are the assets: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RlsOhTVFAssSDHK0bdfDfFzS2jWy1es3?usp=drive_link<br />
2. Use GPT-4 to create the images. Tell it &amp;quot;aged paper with vibrant colors [describe the image].&amp;quot; GPT is VERY important.<br />
3. The intro-writing text is &amp;quot;Noteworthy Light 75 pt font.&amp;quot; Looking for the animation here. Use a different quote so I know you did it yourself. The font is also important.<br />
4. The CapCut captions font is &amp;quot;Sora-Bold 7 pt Font, 40 pt Stroke.&amp;quot; These settings are also very important.<br />
5. The page flip animation should NOT have a white back during the flip. It should match the front paper. Editors not being able to find the correct page flip animation is the biggest reason we&#039;ve had to turn down applicants.<br /><br />
