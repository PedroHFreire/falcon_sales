Great examples of what we&amp;rsquo;re looking for include the following YouTube channels/videos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Jeff Nippard: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IEbWdoceH-A&amp;amp;amp;list=PLp4G6oBUcv8w7mOuaiouhArVD2J4JMW5Z&amp;amp;amp;index=7&amp;amp;amp;ab_channel=JeffNippard&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. I like how he includes the important phrases in words overlaying the video&lt;br /&gt;
2. I like when he uses the image of the study when referencing it and highlighting specific portions when applicable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Gravity Transformation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPNQhfOwHT8&amp;amp;amp;ab_channel=GravityTransformation-FatLossExperts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. Definitely a lot more post production editing and using stock image/videos to highlight what&amp;rsquo;s being discussed.&lt;br /&gt;
2. What I like about having more post-production is that it will be easier for me to record. If I am only on camera for a few moments, I can record those pieces easier and then just use audio recordings for the rest. This will require less work on my end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

1. This is another great example of using exclusively stock footage with voice narration, specific to running. A little less &amp;ldquo;flashy&amp;rdquo; with the editing than gravity transformation example. &lt;br /&gt;
2. I am particularly interested in this format as it would allow us to re-use some of our older podcast audio and turn into compelling video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In terms of process, what would work best for us is sending you the video/audio files we want edited. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ideally, we&amp;rsquo;ll help in the early process of getting you the stock footage and images you need for each video. After a few months, the goal will be to (1) build up a catalog of footage you can choose from; (2) and for you to develop a feel for our style and what we need so you can add your own as you see fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll then edit the video together, send back for revisions on my end, and then finish editing as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You will also be editing a basic intro and outro to videos as well as included call to actions (like subscribe, like, comment below, etc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;ll be looking to edit one or two videos per week to start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In your introduction, let me know which of the three styles above you like best or best suit your skills/expertise and feel free to include any work you&amp;rsquo;ve done that is similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our hiring process will involve interviewing 2-3 candidates and doing a paid test video on one of our shorter, existing previous podcast episodes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for reading and let me know if you have any questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $5.00-$15.00

2. I like when he uses the image of the study when referencing it and highlighting specific portions when applicable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Gravity Transformation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPNQhfOwHT8&amp;amp;amp;ab_channel=GravityTransformation-FatLossExperts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
