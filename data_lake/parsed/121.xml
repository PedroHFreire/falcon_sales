We are working on a Ukrainian mobile application builder https://yourmodule.com/. We are currently looking for a person who can make a demo video of the product. We expect that in the video we will show the advantages, values, results of the product (mobile application) and how it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What we want to get:&lt;br /&gt;
1) video script (we would like to get creative from the freelancer and jointly choose a suitable script)&lt;br /&gt;
2) video up to one minute&lt;br /&gt;
3) video in two languages &#8203;: Ukrainian and English (we are ready to work with a freelancer who doesn&amp;#039;t know Ukrainian, but this will be an advantage)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are considering both options - animated videos and with the participation of real people. We are also considering options with voice acting or subtitles.&lt;br /&gt;
In the future, if we have successful cooperation, we would also like to invite a specialist to create a promotional video for YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please indicate the approximate amount of work (hours) or price.&lt;br /&gt;
We will also definitely look at the portfolio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
