So this will be a reenactment of what a day of a financial advisor is for our firm. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For example:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Financial Advisors name is Joe.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Joe is waking in his house, has a modern home with lots of tech. Joe wakes up and says Good Morning Rosey, what&amp;#039;s on my agenda for today. Rosey is similar to Siri or Alexa. Rosey resonds with the appointments he has on his calendar for the day. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For example: Rosey says Good Morning Joe - Today on your schedule you have a meeting with Sally and Ryan in Fort Lauderdale. Your appointment time is at 1 PM, Traffic is clear but you should expect your drive time to be about 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To prepare for your meeting, Sally and Ryan have about 750,000 in assets and are looking for growth and income for the rest of their life. They also want to discuss legacy plans. Sally and Ryan also own their own outright. They have no outstanding debts and both will be looking to retire within the next year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While this is all happening, he will be standing in his kitchen drinking his coffee. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Then we can go into the scene of the advisor driving to meet the client and also go through the meeting with the client. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Would love to get feedback and some thoughts on the timeline of getting a project like this done and what is needed to do so. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 22, 2024 14:52 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Video Production&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:AI-Generated Video

Would love to get feedback and some thoughts on the timeline of getting a project like this done and what is needed to do so. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 22, 2024 14:52 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Video Production&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:AI-Generated Video
