The masterclass is like a webinar, the editing needs to be smooth and nice. No over-used stock footage or cheap SFX money &amp;#039;ka-ching&amp;#039; sounds.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The masterclass consists out of:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Intro (talking head, me in my living room)&lt;br /&gt;
2) Value (Loom video + face recording)&lt;br /&gt;
3) Pitch/Outro (talking head, me in my living room)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;#039;s a talking head video where I sit in my living room, together with screen recordings. I will do all cuts myself, you only need to do the animations, texts, sfx, zoom-ins etc to give it a high quality feeling. The goal is to make the masterclass easy to watch so people can digest the information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
An example of this editing:&lt;br /&gt;

Please reply with your best work that matches the talking head style, if you don&amp;#039;t include an example I wont&amp;#039; respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
