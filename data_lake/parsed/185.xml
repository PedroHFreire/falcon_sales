We have an upcoming project in Palm Springs, CA. Since this post is going up last-minute, we can offer a range of dates that could work for this video shoot to happen (this Thursday, June 20th - Tuesday June 25th, depending upon availability, but earlier is better).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking for a videographer who can capture social media content (vertical orientation) of the interior design, as well as some drone footage. Regarding deliverables, we&amp;#039;re looking for the items outlined in this document:&lt;br /&gt;
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1O3Hzdprd4vlxZwN31W-viQNKHKrlfkfsJmhiYi1ttzw/edit?usp=sharing &lt;br /&gt;
^included in this document are links to our &amp;amp;quot;inspiration&amp;amp;quot; videos as a style benchmark&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As you&amp;#039;ll see the deliverables should require very little editing. We mostly want the clips outlined in the shot lists (edited w/ any necessary color correction) delivered separately. We won&amp;#039;t need you to compile full IG reels/TiktToks with this content&amp;mdash;our internal team will handle that part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The location is a 2,000 sqft home with 4 bedrooms, a living room, dining room, game room, as well as a pool and other outdoor amenities in the backyard. Judging by similar shoots we&amp;#039;ve done in the past, I&amp;#039;d expect the filming time to take around 2 hours total.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are interested in and available for this shoot, I&amp;#039;d appreciate it if you could send over a couple of samples (social media videos preferably) that demonstrate your comfort-level with the style we&amp;#039;re aiming for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $300

This has been a 3 month project and now it&amp;#039;s ready to launch, so I&amp;#039;m making a video to promote it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I made a rough-edit of a 10 minute video myself, which visualizes and explains how the AI works in a beginner friendly way, but I&amp;#039;d like to work with a editor with traditional filmmaking expertise to help me make the animations and audio really stand out. The goal is to make a viral video for the average viewer with some interest in AI or Fortnite. There&amp;#039;s a mix of gameplay footage, animations, and camera footage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The current edit is like a mix of these 2 videos I made before but the software I built is much bigger in scope and will be a long-term product. Normally I would just finish the edit myself but I care a lot about this video and want to make it as good as possible! &lt;br /&gt;
