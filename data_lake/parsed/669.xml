I am starting a new podcast. We have recorded about 7 episodes so far. &lt;br /&gt;
We used two GoPros to record the video. &lt;br /&gt;
One facing the hosts and one facing the guests. &lt;br /&gt;
GoPros split the long hour recording up into multiple files. &lt;br /&gt;
Then the audio was recorded separately &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I will clean up the audio&lt;br /&gt;
And send you the audio stems &lt;br /&gt;
And the video files from each go pro&lt;br /&gt;
For each of the episodes (each episode goes for about 30-60min)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I want you to sync the audio / video. &lt;br /&gt;
Then just do a basic cut of each episode &lt;br /&gt;
Where it just cuts back and forth between each camera based on who is talking. &lt;br /&gt;
Don&amp;#039;t need any fancy cutting&lt;br /&gt;
Or captions &lt;br /&gt;
Or effects &lt;br /&gt;
As I will use software to create reels out of things if I need to &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This could become a regular thing for you if the price is right for us&lt;br /&gt;
As we&amp;#039;ll be doing many more episodes this year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $3.00-$8.00

Our most effective ads are UGC video style ads, so we are looking for an editor who can do fairly simple video editing for us for these UGC videos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For the most part, this will involve adding captions and possibly our logo - so, pretty easy.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However some videos may require inserting product b-roll (still pretty straightforward).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking for someone who has a good feel for UGC ads and can turn things around FAST.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We will start with 2-3 videos that I need done right away, but if things go well, I would hope this could become a regular gig with a 1=2 videos per week. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $5.00-$14.00

Do not apply if you have time restraints or charge more than $15 for high quality short form video edits up to 60 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need edits EXACTLY like this and at this level - https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8vzN6-NEV-/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
30+ videos a month are needed and I need the editor to be able to go through the webinar to pick the clips included in the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are all video editors and understand what we are asking for. Please do not apply if you cannot make videos up to this level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Should be able to edit 1 video a day minimum but there will be more work than that, I need back revisions quickly and the ability to move fast and urgent.
