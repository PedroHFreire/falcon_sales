The videos have been previously shot and an adobe premier project has been started. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The videographer states there are some sound issues in one of the videos and auto-tracking was set on one of the shots so we may not be able to use that particular video. We would like to see what we can salvage out of that. We would also like to add some light background music to the video but have not picked out that music yet. We&amp;#039;re open to suggestions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For the style of video think Chick-Fil-A commercials but longer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I will send the video outline and &amp;amp;quot;script&amp;amp;quot; to you once hired. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $500
