I am looking for someone who can help me create the best possible product pictures for my brand. We just did a big photo shoot and had a lot of UGC, 3D models of our products, and videos to use. Specifically Jewelry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am looking for someone who will use all of our existing content, to create the best pictures that will sell the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Main Example 1: https://moonmagic.com/collections/all-bestsellers/products/flow-ring-stardust-band?variant=39469970784328&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Example 2: https://spacegoods.com/en-eu/products/rainbow-dust-premium-starter-kit-coffee&lt;br /&gt;
Example 3: https://podcompany.com/products/the-ice-pod&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As you can see, they all use a mix of photos of the actual products, renders with USPs, vibe photos, graphic design on a photo, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need to do the same for our jewelry brand, with all of our existing content, call out all the USPs in the product photos, select the best photos, use videos, really sell the product, all in the style and vibe of our brand, and new website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please only apply if you have previous experience and include previous work so I can see what you have done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
