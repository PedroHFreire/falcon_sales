We need to turn hundreds of real estate listings into videos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;#039;ll get the voiceover, the property images, and the description. Your task will be to create a template (essentially a standard video style) that we&amp;#039;ll be able to reuse repeatedly by changing the property data. In other words, the transitions, the structure, the text elements, and the animations will remain the same; we just plug in one real estate listing after the other. Your job is to create a stunning template that will work reasonably well with hundreds of different properties. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our videos will be 2 minutes long, so that&amp;#039;s how long the template needs to be initially. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;#039;ll be working with photos (on average 20-30 photos per listing), so what we need is somebody skilled enough to create an exciting video with transitions, texts, and effects that would keep the user&amp;#039;s attention for 2 minutes, even though the underlying material is relatively static (as we are talking about 20-30 photos). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is not your average video editing job&amp;mdash;it&amp;#039;s more of an interesting and creative exercise where you create a template that we can utilize over and over again. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you enjoy doing something challenging and excited to help us turn relatively boring images into stunning and captivating videos, this is your opportunity! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
