The primary niche is infographics.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I&amp;#039;ll be covering a range of topics including science, tech and history.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The format will vary depending on the individual topic but will either be a story telling format or a listicle format (top 10, etc).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Looking for videos to be 10 minutes long&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Video editor should be able to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
* Speak fluent English&lt;br /&gt;
* Communicate effectively&lt;br /&gt;
* Turn around time in 3 days or less&lt;br /&gt;
* Be creative and humorous&lt;br /&gt;
* MUST be able to edit a MINIMUM of at least 2 videos a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have read the middle of this job description, please type your favorite animal at the beginning or end of your proposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This initial contract is a trial but if we work well together this would become a full time gig with consistent work on a weekly basis. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will be providing the script and voice over.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We simply need visuals for it and for the video to be put together nicely and creatively with some animations, clips, royalty free images and music. Would be a big help if you are able to provide attractive thumbnails as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here is an example of the style of video I&amp;#039;m looking for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9mVRc80vhhQ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
TAKE NOTE how it has the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- THE BEGINNING OF THE VIDEO- has a clip that is EXTREMELY relevant to the title&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Shows the subheadings with appeal and emphasis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Additional Questions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- How many videos can you handle per week?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- To the best of your understanding, can you rephrase what kind of video I am seeking?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $30

&amp;bull; How does Bright Side make $142k per month just with AdSense ?!&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Why YouTube blocking AdBlock is a GOOD thing for all of us.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; They LIED : CTR is the worst metric to measure video success !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Those are some of the topics I would like to talk about on my new youtube channel.&lt;br /&gt;
Go have a look @MilkyWay-li&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s going to be about youtube, youtubers, and youtube business.&lt;br /&gt;
Its purpose will be to help big and small entrepreneurs to grow their channel and monetize their content.&lt;br /&gt;
I call them digital farmers and I&amp;rsquo;ll show them how to milk cash cow channels to make a comfortable living.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But I have a problem. (hero&amp;rsquo;s journey ?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I know how youtube works, what the algorithm does, what makes a good thumbnail, title, editing and how to select a format and a topic and even create a brand !&lt;br /&gt;
However I am very bad at writing. I can do it but it will take me days, will burn my mind and be a poor result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So I venture into the world of freelance, battle with the search engine, fight the bad profiles, and finally I find the holy grail.&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s a&amp;hellip; a sort of&amp;hellip; a kinda&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
It looks like a monster, really. &lt;br /&gt;
It has the inquisitive and perspicacious mind of a journalist eager to share his findings, combined with the gluttony addiction for the most eclectic style of youtube content that a Gen Z otaku would have, and not forgetting the mad marketer who knows the audience deepest secret including what it had for breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now if only I could get this magnificent creature to write my video scripts during the night&amp;hellip; then I would have a magical wand and I would summon kick ass videos everywhere and the competitors would be like &amp;amp;quot;what the fuck is going on ??&amp;amp;quot; and the noob youtubers would be like &amp;amp;quot;holly cow ! I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen this before, this is it guys, it&amp;rsquo;s the portal we&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for to jump into the world of opportunities and abundance !&amp;amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

However I am very bad at writing. I can do it but it will take me days, will burn my mind and be a poor result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So I venture into the world of freelance, battle with the search engine, fight the bad profiles, and finally I find the holy grail.&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;s a&amp;hellip; a sort of&amp;hellip; a kinda&amp;hellip;&lt;br /&gt;
It looks like a monster, really. &lt;br /&gt;
It has the inquisitive and perspicacious mind of a journalist eager to share his findings, combined with the gluttony addiction for the most eclectic style of youtube content that a Gen Z otaku would have, and not forgetting the mad marketer who knows the audience deepest secret including what it had for breakfast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Now if only I could get this magnificent creature to write my video scripts during the night&amp;hellip; then I would have a magical wand and I would summon kick ass videos everywhere and the competitors would be like &amp;amp;quot;what the fuck is going on ??&amp;amp;quot; and the noob youtubers would be like &amp;amp;quot;holly cow ! I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen this before, this is it guys, it&amp;rsquo;s the portal we&amp;rsquo;ve been waiting for to jump into the world of opportunities and abundance !&amp;amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Beasty beasty, is that you ?&lt;br /&gt;
Writy writy, application go through !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Okay this was the fun job post, now here is the traditional one :&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Passionate about the creator economy? Deciphering algorithms? Generating views?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Then this job might be a perfect fit for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m Simon, a YouTube consultant, and I&amp;#039;m seeking a writer and a video editor to collaborate on creating the first 10-15 minute video for a new YouTube channel. This channel will serve as an acquisition channel for my channel audit and YouTube growth training services.&lt;br /&gt;
Once the process is streamlined, I aim to publish at least 20 videos, one per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The channel will draw inspiration from Paddy Galloway, Nate Black, 0xSuperPrime, and Film Booth, while maintaining a unique format and brand identity.&lt;br /&gt;
The channel will be trilingual: English, French, and Spanish. I will handle the translation and synchronized voiceovers.&lt;br /&gt;
The work will not be rushed, but an avatar in my likeness will be used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
