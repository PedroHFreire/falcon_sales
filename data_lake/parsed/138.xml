I am seeking a videographer in the Indianapolis area for 8/23/24! Our objective is to shoot a 1 min video capturing our charity organization, Wicked Awesome Wishes, volunteering for children with life-altering conditions at The Children&amp;#039;s Museum. The tentative plan would be to shoot for 2 hours then create the edit. The shoot should consist of our volunteers interacting with the children, event activities, etc.; we would open and close with our Wicked Awesome Wishes logo. I have attached a link to a video filmed in our North Carolina market as an example of what we&amp;#039;re looking for. We would need a handful of still photos of our volunteers and attendees at the event as well.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;All assets will be shared via email to use for the edit. We are looking for a fixed-fee project proposal. I look forward to hearing from you.&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $300
