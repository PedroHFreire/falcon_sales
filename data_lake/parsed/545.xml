Here is a Sample Video: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oQ83_fQxkmZRLPE5lWOuq9jVC-rod8wo/view?usp=sharing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have attached two more sample videos as well as the specs for our Kinetic video wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Basically we would be providing you with the videos (Corporate Overview, various logos, and standard videos we already have) and we&amp;rsquo;d need you to do the rest to ensure the videos look correct on the kinetic wall. We are also open to any and all suggestions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are not sure how many videos we would like created as this really depends on how long it takes to create one video. At a minimum we would like 3-4 videos if possible. These can range from 30 seconds to 5 minutes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are standard videos we use, we would like to work with the videos that will work the best for the Kinetic video wall: &lt;br /&gt;

</description><ns0:encoded>We run a channel that focuses on sharing the latest news within the geo-economic/political space (most of our videos are on BRICS partnership, de-dollarisation &amp;amp;amp; Chinese economy/latest news).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our goal is to be uploading at least x3 vides per week, and this frequency will increase over time. Ideally, we want someone who has knowledge of economic/political space, and remains up to date on the latest news regularly. Of course as mentioned our budget is $15 per video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Also must be able to communicate easily in English and get on a zoom call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here&amp;rsquo;s a google docs with the step by step instructions to how the content will be made:&lt;br /&gt;
