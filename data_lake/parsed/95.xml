</description><ns0:encoded>So my I&amp;#039;m helping my husband start a Youtube Channel and we need help specifically with the VISUALS on the Channel (banner, theme thumbnails, video editing).&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ideally I&amp;#039;d like to be able to give you the theme/ tone/ vibe we&amp;#039;re going for, send you some videos and you add the text graphics, music, all video editing and then send it back to me in a format that I can easily upload to the Channel.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am not looking for you to help with Marketing, this is strictly content creation.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I primarily video him from my iPhone currently.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So I don&amp;#039;t&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;care your location as long as we can easily transfer information/ video/ communicate with one another and you have a quick turn around time.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We don&amp;#039;t have big budget so but this could be quick work and a long term project for the right person.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I&amp;#039;ll put a link the channel below.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I&amp;#039;m pretty good with the &amp;amp;quot;shorts&amp;amp;quot; but again videos on YouTube are presenting me with a challenge.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I don&amp;#039;t really care how many years of experience or degrees you have just that you have done this before, we can communicate easily and the turn around time is quick and that we can transfer the videos to one another quickly and easy. &lt;br /&gt;
