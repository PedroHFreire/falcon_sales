All the footage is shot and will be provided. It&amp;#039;s a scripted video of me talking, with cutaways to provided photos and videos as per the script instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here is the script:&lt;br /&gt;
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b780dJS0RP7QzImmnKR3jEzFuOaxGcX-3OqLb9Y5-0Y/edit?usp=sharing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have split the script in 8 sections. Here is the first video from section 1 (introduction):&lt;br /&gt;
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RTyB8rAyXNs8oxq1bh73n7n9RTHlWfIJ/view?usp=sharing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The footage is not word-perfect to the script.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Each video is labelled against its section in the script. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are a total of 22 videos covering the 8 sections, as outtakes have been retained in case needed. Outtakes will be labelled. Each video is average 40-60 seconds. No video is more than 2 mins. The end result will be less than 10 mins when fully compiled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Photos for cutaways will be provided e.g. &lt;br /&gt;
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1q_Bxu8jj72za140jjTSITlFfrDJ98Heg/view?usp=sharing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Video in 1080. I think this is a fairly simple job, but needs someone with intermediate experience who can complile the footage and get the transitions and cutaways looking professional and timed well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;ll also provide any other resources requested e.g.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Logos&lt;br /&gt;
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w_G4lpuaa-UeDV2u7HJpUjcwD1rEtb2K?usp=sharing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Testimonial videos - there should be at least 1 testimonal clip at the end. &lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dv4T-XptAWY&amp;amp;amp;list=PLIS6ko42pzKUD0h4jQiApyQQI7mh3KB1b&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The final video will replace the one currently at cyclecities.mn.co&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;#039;re interested in this job, please tell me how you understand the script and purpose of the video, and what you could do to make it great! If you have suggestions on how the video/script could be improved, I would also be happy to hear those. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Any questions, please ask. &lt;br /&gt;
Looking forward to working with you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks,&lt;br /&gt;
