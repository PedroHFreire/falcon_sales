I will be providing the script and voiceover, and need someone to pull relevant footage related to the script. Some of the video footage can be provided, but you will need to find additional footage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please share some samples of YouTube channels you are currently working on &amp;amp;amp; UGC videos &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The topic of the channel will be obscure Wikipedia articles. The first video will be regarding the death of Mussolini. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benito_Mussolini#Death&lt;br /&gt;
Some footage can be found on the wikipedia, however you will need to source more footage, and match the script to the video&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please only apply if you have experience making UGC content, and are not an agency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
