Cinematic / Sci-fi&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;in nature.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am looking for multiple Pro contractors to create their own masterpiece based on the details I provide once we chat! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Each contractor will create their own version. There will multiple versions (from other contractors) and the best one created will be the final intro! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The deadline is July 1st. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are interested, please let me know! I currently have 1 contractor working on their version so length of time and requested price will play a huge factor in determining who I contact. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
