I provide raw footage (iphone) and a recipe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You provide an edited finished video that matches my fast-paced style of editing... you provide both a finished video file *AND* a DaVinci project file within 24 hours&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
USD $5 per video&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Similar style to these videos: (link removed)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Notes:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; finished video 12-25 seconds (however there can be easily 20-30 minutes of raw footage)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; video typically begins with a finished shot of the food, then a clip of me tasting the food, then the body of the video is the cooking&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; video to loop&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; there should be no clips where I am looking at the camera (except for the clip where I eat the food or if I am talking to camera)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; leave the cooking sounds in the video. if there is talking, birds, cars or other noise that is not cooking sounds, please turn the volume down for that clip only&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; most clips to be 0.5 seconds or less - there can be anywhere from 50-80 small clips in a 20 second video&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; try to include smooth transitions between clips where possible (e.g. hand lifting up food from a chopping board, then the next clip is the hands moving to place the food onto a frypan, so it looks like one smooth movement)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; do not speed up or slow down the footage&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; refer to my screen recording as an example of how I edit a video (but note that it is only a partial edit - it is the body of the video, it is missing the finished plate of the meal and the tasting footage) (link removed)&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; no music&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; no captions&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; no text on screen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $5

Our videographer is out of the country at that time, and we need someone to fill his shoes for the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need to get videos of angles, subjects, and things similar to the following videos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlTORpugs8w&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzHWxRJvis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will have 2 competitors who need to be filmed, along with b-roll footage of other competitors, the venue, equipment, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need one videographer with one camera, preferably a Sony FX3 or something comparable with a gimbal and a rode mic with a dead cat. Having a set of wireless lav mics will come in handy for quick interview-type footage we can splice in between the action shots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We can provide all the equipment, but we would have to bring everything from California, so we prefer that you have comparable equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There is no need to edit the videos. We just need the raw footage, as we have an editing team. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
