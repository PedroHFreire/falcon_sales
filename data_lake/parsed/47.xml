As such, I am compiling a video &amp;amp;quot;trailer&amp;amp;quot; for book series using stock video. I have an amateur level of skill with PremierPro and AfterEffects so I have developed a draft of what I&amp;#039;d generally like the video to look like, but it still has a somewhat amateurish quality. I am looking for some assistance from a more experienced video editor to take this to the next level. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $11.00-$33.00

We are looking for a versatile, bilingual French-English virtual assistant who can help us with some of our work. Various tasks will be assigned, and we will train you remotely. Depending on availability and fees, there is the possibility of working 100 to 150 hours per month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For a YouTube channel, you will be required to evaluate videos on the theme of video games, among other topics. Your evaluations will be used to prepare edits. You will have an important role and will need to be very meticulous and disciplined, in addition to having strong writing skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For the same YouTube channel, you may also be required to do video editing. We will teach you our working methods (we can teach you how to make clips if needed), provide our tools, and explain the values that should be reflected in these projects. You will have a very strict set of specifications to follow. You must be organized and rigorous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ideally, you are available to dedicate 23 to 35 hours per week to us and are willing to commit long-term, as we do not want to repeatedly teach our working methods. The work is truly enjoyable, the edits will not be tedious, and they will not represent the entirety of the job. You will manage the YouTube channel to directly post the videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally, our channel is really cool, and we have some very original projects in preparation. However, it currently does not generate any revenue, and your service is a luxury we allow ourselves at the cost of many personal sacrifices. Please be mindful to remain modest in the salary you request and consider that you will be growing with us as our situation improves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Having a good internet connection would be a real plus for large downloads and video conferences, as well as being passionate about new technologies, Formula 1, and/or video games, which are some of the topics covered on the channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you for reading and good luck in your search for clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Voiceover: I have a voiceover that is 6 minutes and 10 seconds long.&lt;br /&gt;
Script: A completed writing script is ready to accompany the voiceover.&lt;br /&gt;
Video Content Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
Engaging Animations: I am looking for dynamic and captivating animations that align with the voiceover content, rather than relying solely on B-roll footage. Here are some animation ideas (All of these do not have to be incorprate but what ever best fit the content):&lt;br /&gt;
Animated Characters: Friendly characters demonstrating baby care tips and routines.&lt;br /&gt;
Infographic-Style Animations: Presenting important statistics, tips, and how-to guides with engaging text and icons.&lt;br /&gt;
Step-by-Step: Clear visuals and labels for baby care activities like diaper changing and bathing.&lt;br /&gt;
Interactive Q&amp;amp;amp;A: Animated characters answering common viewer questions with speech bubbles and text animations.&lt;br /&gt;
Data or Routine Charts: Illustrating daily baby or impotant statistical data and routines with colorful charts and animations.&lt;br /&gt;
Gadzhi Style Editing: Incorporation of elements of the Gadzhi style to ensure the video remains lively and engaging for viewers.&lt;br /&gt;
Target Audience: The video should primarily focus on a female audience, particularly mothers and caregivers. The content should be relatable and visually appealing to this demographic.&lt;br /&gt;
Purpose: The video is intended for my baby care YouTube channel, which aims to provide valuable content to parents and caregivers in an engaging and visually appealing manner.&lt;br /&gt;
Length: The final video should closely match the voiceover length, approximately 6 minutes and 10 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;
Visual Elements: Use of soft colors, soothing backgrounds, and gentle transitions is preferred to align with the baby care theme.&lt;br /&gt;
Additional Details:&lt;br /&gt;
Revisions: I would like to include up to 3 revisions in the project scope to ensure the final video meets the desired quality and content standards.&lt;br /&gt;
Format: The final video should be delivered in MP4 format with a resolution of 1080p.&lt;br /&gt;
Style and Tone: The video should have a warm, inviting, and friendly tone. It should evoke trust and comfort, making it easy for viewers to follow along and engage with the content.&lt;br /&gt;
Timeline: In your reply Please provide your estimated turnaround time for this project, including initial delivery and revision periods. The insert the words &amp;amp;quot;Happy Day&amp;amp;quot; :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $30
