I run a leading influencer marketing agency based in the UK focusing on gaming, tech and entertainment clients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have an exciting project for a mobile gaming client in which we need to create a number of short form videos in French.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
How the project works is we currently gift mobile phone controllers to influencers who create and make content for our use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We would then need a talented French-speaking short form editor to make edits to the content the influencers provide. These assets will then be used on Instagram reels, stories, tiktoks and facebook&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You would have to do editing work such as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Adding on screen text&lt;br /&gt;
- Transitions&lt;br /&gt;
- Effects&lt;br /&gt;
- Cutting and Splicing&lt;br /&gt;
- Editing different pieces of content together&lt;br /&gt;
- and more&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This will not be a massive amount of work and we are looking to work on a pay per edit basis and likelihood is you would have a maximum of 5-7 simple edits per month for the following 6 months. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Should this go well, we would look to onboard you for more projects with French clients or English speaking clients. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please apply if this is you and attach your portfolio of short form edits and also your rate per edit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To progress to an interview for this role we would be looking for you to create a sample edit for us using footage that we provide so we can verify the quality of your work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 26, 2024 09:23 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Video Editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:TikTok Video,     Short Video Ad,     YouTube Shorts,     Instagram Reels,     Video Editing,     French,     Video Production,     Video Post-Editing

We have an exciting project for a mobile gaming client in which we need to create a number of short form videos in French.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
How the project works is we currently gift mobile phone controllers to influencers who create and make content for our use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
