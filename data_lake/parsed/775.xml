We are preparing to launch our &amp;amp;quot;launchpad&amp;amp;quot; course for additional fundraising and building our student base. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Two videos are here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cvDCGTy_x2jg4AkxCihnXphj1kEIWm1d?usp=sharing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
these need to have animations to help create a visual explanation of the contents being described. The scripts are also attached with instructions on the kinds of animations I would like to see. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some samples of animations I found cool, but they do not need to be this detailed: &lt;br /&gt;

Simple animations are fine, I want to keep the budget low to $500 or less. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If we can come to a good price and quality there is opportunities to animate MANY more courses for our other educators who have committed to the platform. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $19.00-$39.00
