The pay is $150 per week. This is the starting rate and will increase for someone who takes this seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Key Responsibilities:&lt;br /&gt;
- Conduct focused research on YouTube to find small channels that have recently published videos which have gained significant viewership within the last 30 days. This will help me to understand what type of content is gaining traction in my current market&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Example: YT channel with 1.5k subs and average video views of 150 but then has a business video with 5k views.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Ideal Candidate:&lt;br /&gt;
- Experienced in conducting in-depth YouTube research, especially in relation to video trends and competitors.&lt;br /&gt;
- Familiar with tools and methods for advanced YouTube channel and video analysis.&lt;br /&gt;
- Strong analytical skills to identify relevant data and patterns from the research.&lt;br /&gt;
- Excellent communication skills to present findings clearly and concisely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This project requires a freelancer who is capable of providing me with detailed insights into specific content trends on YouTube, which will help me to make informed decisions for my own content strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is for 2 channels. One is for sales content (examples: how to get better at sales or how to improve your closing rate) the other is for business oe ecommerce content. Whichever is more popular (examples: how to start a service based business)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Only bids that are for $150 will be considered because otherwise you did not read the scope of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I need 12 - 15 results per channel so 24 - 30 results total. The deliverable is an spread sheet with Channel name, video link, video title and keywords (if there are any)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $150
