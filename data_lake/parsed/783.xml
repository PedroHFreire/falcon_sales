- Best SIG SAUER&amp;#039;s for 2024&lt;br /&gt;
- If sometimes we want to go into the political to spark some comments we can talk about - What does the Sin Tax in California look like at the register? After July 1st, what can consumers do to adjust to the increase in taxes? Stop buying? No!&lt;br /&gt;
- Top 5 AR&amp;#039;s for Home and why?&lt;br /&gt;

Video Scripts:&lt;br /&gt;
Right now, we are looking for 2 videos, these are the questions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Video 1: Who provides ABA therapy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A BCBA (Board Certified Behavior Therapist) will conduct an assessment.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;She will use the data from this assessment as well as the parents&amp;#039; concerns to create an individualized plan for the child. This will cover areas of behavior, learning, communications, social, life and independent skills. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The RBT (Registered Behavior Technician) is the child&amp;rsquo;s one-on-one therapist who will work on the goals designed by the BCBA daily. She will take data to ensure progress and effectiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The BCBA will supervise the RBT and monitor and update the goals. She also has monthly or bi-monthly meetings with the parents and caregivers to go over goals, discuss progress, and answer any questions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Video 2: When should a child start ABA therapy?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The research is always clear on the importance of starting young with early intervention. If a child begins working on communication skills during the years that he or she is supposed to be learning to communicate, the process will be much simpler, and the gap will be much smaller. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Children who begin ABA during the early intervention window (ages 0-6) will have stronger communication skills which often leads to less frustration and decreased behaviors. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you give a child the support he or she needs as they develop, they will learn to function, communicate, and thrive. Delaying ABA therapy can cause increased delays, lack of 	communication, frustration, confusion, and increased and severe behaviors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $200
