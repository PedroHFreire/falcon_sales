I&amp;#039;m looking for a long term article video editor who can compile clips and images to match a script that we provide related to the following topics:&lt;br /&gt;
Celebrity News/Scandals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Video editor should be able to do the following:&lt;br /&gt;
* Speak fluent English&lt;br /&gt;
* Communicate effectively&lt;br /&gt;
* Turn around time in 3 days or less&lt;br /&gt;
* Be creative and humorous&lt;br /&gt;
* MUST be able to edit a MINIMUM of at least 4 videos a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have read the middle of this job descp., please type your favorite animal at the beginning or end of your proposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As you can tell, I am looking for the long-term video editor and do have high expectations, but keep in mind, this will be consistent daily work if you are able to provide and this will be compensated quite well.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We have been working with 4 video editors already for 3+ months but we need more to join our team!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Again, we will be providing the script and voiceover, we will simply need visuals for it and for it to be put together nicely and creatively with some slight animations (i.e. for the title screens)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So for the first type of video, here is what we&amp;rsquo;re looking, below is our best preforming video so far:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
https://youtu.be/PaMfCczuO6k?si=AUsT7E1S7mhr6Z6_&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
TAKE NOTE how it has the following:&lt;br /&gt;
-THE BEGINNING OF THE VIDEO- Show a clip that is EXTREMELY relevant to the title, essentially a clip with audio (OPTIONAL: only do this if you understand the niche)&lt;br /&gt;
-Show the numbers with appeal and emphasis; if it&amp;rsquo;s not a countdown script, show the subheadings&lt;br /&gt;
-Video editor will need to find 3 types of visuals: clips w/ audio, clips w/o audio, and images&lt;br /&gt;
-All visuals can be ripped but should never last longer than 6 seconds&lt;br /&gt;
-Entire video should be greater than 8 minutes unless otherwise indicated&lt;br /&gt;
-Background music should be copyright free&lt;br /&gt;
-Show AT LEAST 1 clip with audio every minute afterwards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is our GUIDELINE that we follow across all our videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Potential contractors will be interviewed through phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are more examples of videos we need done similar to: &lt;br /&gt;

Please also read our Standard Operating Procedure Thoroughly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Additional Questions:&lt;br /&gt;
Are you okay with the rate of $100 for 5 videos?&lt;br /&gt;
How many videos can you handle per week?&lt;br /&gt;
To the best of your understanding, can you rephrase what kind of video I am seeking?&lt;br /&gt;
You will be instantly hired if you created a top 10 or faceless youtube videos before. Have you created one?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $40
