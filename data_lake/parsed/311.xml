This position will require you to think creatively, work independently and have the availability for quick turnaround times. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;rsquo;ll need to speak English fluently, have image design (ideally canva) expertise, basic video editing skills (creating reels/shorts), and have a strong grasp of the types of content working on social media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our ideal candidate will be able to use a combination of prompts and AI generated ideas to take the longer form content and make it into visually appealing social posts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here is an example workflow we&amp;rsquo;d love to use to illustrate what we&amp;rsquo;re looking for&amp;hellip;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. After our audio-only podcast episode is finished editing, you&amp;rsquo;ll get an automated notification with links to all the content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2. You&amp;rsquo;ll retrieve the audio file and upload it to some form of AI (GPT, Castmagic, Descript) to get ideas for carousels, tweet threads, and other formats that will perform well on social.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3. Based on the outputs, you&amp;rsquo;ll decide which format would work best. This is where you&amp;rsquo;ll need to think independently since different types of episodes will lend themselves to performing better with different formats. You&amp;rsquo;ll need to decide what the best format will be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
4. Using the AI responses as a guide, you&amp;rsquo;ll start creating the images and crafting the captions/text. This will require creativity and also strong English skills since AI content usually needs to be modified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
5. Once all the content is created, you&amp;rsquo;ll upload to the appropriate folders/locations and update our databases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a general example of what we&amp;rsquo;re looking for. For each content-type we&amp;rsquo;ll have slightly different instructions (i.e. youtube videos will require creating shorts and reels) but the overall production flow will be similar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;ll be looking to create 4-6 pieces of content each week (podcast, youtube, blog, social prompts).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;rsquo;ll consider all applicants and then choose 2-4 people to move to the next round where we will have you do a paid test run. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have experience performing a very similar role, please highlight this in your application (links are super helpful). Likewise, if you have specific experience in the running/endurance training world, mention this in your application. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $5.00-$15.00
