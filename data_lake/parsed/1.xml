For this job, I&amp;#039;d like you to find 3 different clips that I can use to voiceover and edit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My goal is to create videos similar to those on the Brad Nolan youtube channel:&lt;br /&gt;
 - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/22KkTmE-cwY&lt;br /&gt;
 - https://www.youtube.com/shorts/34jYd0SICDE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So I &amp;#039;d like you to find clips similar to those featured in the linked videos and other animal ones on that channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To be clear, I DON&amp;#039;T want finished videos like the ones linked, but rather similar clips to the ones those videos use. The videos are just to give you an idea of what the finished product will look like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;d like the clips to have no watermark or a small watermark that can be easily hidden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;d also prefer the videos that aren&amp;#039;t too popular or come from less popular platforms such as vk or douyin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please no clips from Youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m paying $4 per clip, and will HIRE AGAIN if the job is done well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let me know if you have any questions!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $12

Our video project is nearly complete, but we require a skilled video editor to add the finishing touches and elevate the overall quality. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Due to an unexpected personal situation, our previous editor is no longer available to complete the work. We need someone who can step in and finish the project within the next 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The main tasks will involve:&lt;br /&gt;
- Adjusting colors to ensure a visually appealing and consistent look throughout the video&lt;br /&gt;
- Fine-tuning font sizes to improve readability and visual impact&lt;br /&gt;
- Perfecting the timing of effects to enhance the flow and engagement of the video&lt;br /&gt;
- Polishing the video to achieve a professional and high-quality end result&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The project files are in Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects. To give you an idea of the video&amp;#039;s current state, please take a look at the latest version provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you have the skills and experience to deliver these final improvements and can commit to the 24-hour deadline, we would love to hear from you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please submit your proposal, along with your relevant experience and portfolio, as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

For this job, I&amp;#039;d like you to edit together the clips and audio that I will provide. The final videos should be:&lt;br /&gt;
- Edited to combine the best parts of multiple clips into an engaging 30-60s video&lt;br /&gt;

- Timed and edited to align well with voiceover that I will provide separately&lt;br /&gt;

I&amp;#039;m offering $20 for the video, start to finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Script:&lt;br /&gt;
You won&amp;rsquo;t believe what this dog did when he saw a small kitten drowning in the water. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The dog spotted a kitten in the lake crying out for help as she tried to claw her way back to the ground with her tiny paws. He stood right at the edge of the lake and tried to reach for her. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But when he realized she was too far away, he jumped into the water with her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The dog gently grabbed the kitten in his mouth and for a moment, the kitten struggled against him, not realizing that he was her savior. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But as the dog carried her to safety, the kitten calmed down and began to trust him. The dog rushed out of the water, soaked and shaking, but breathing a sigh of relief. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The kitten will forever remember this kind dog. If you find this story heartwarming, please subscribe&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $20
