We are a young start-up, a Mexican beverage brand specializing in healthy sodas with a functional twist of caffeine and tea bases. &lt;br /&gt;
For a re-launch campaign and also for ongoing content creations, we are looking for photographers, or passionated content creators (can also be UCG, or with smartphone) that can produce content mainly in the form of: photos, short videos, mashups...&lt;br /&gt;
and are able to quickly edit/cut them according towards our needs. As long as it is fitting our design language and brand personality/expectations we do not care if you do this highly professional with e.g. indesign, photoshop etc. or if you directly edit everything with your smartphone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As we plan to launch our new product in approximately 1 month, we are seeking a passionate individual to help us reactivate our social media presence. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The ideal candidate will be able to handle various tasks independently, including &lt;br /&gt;
-content creation (professional pictures, videos..)&lt;br /&gt;
-content editing using common tools&lt;br /&gt;
-and being a skilled storyteller&lt;br /&gt;
-Additionally/Optionally, we are looking for someone who can also join events, festivals to create content directly on site (Normally, content production can take place at your place or in the city CDMX)&lt;br /&gt;
-ideally living in CDMX&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While we understand that not all applicants will excel in every aspect listed, we appreciate honesty in identifying your strengths and areas you are comfortable covering. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please note that we may also explore TikTok in the future.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are a start-up and would ideally like to establish a long-term working relationship with someone who can grow with us and take on more responsibilities such as e.g. attending events on our behalf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In terms of compensation, we are open to discussion and considering a monthly retainer with fixed set of content pieces (e.g. X pictures &amp;amp;amp; Y videos per month).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We highly value results and will generously acknowledge your contribution if valuable outcomes are achieved. &lt;br /&gt;
ATTENTION: Current Budget is a placeholder amount&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However, please understand that as a small start-up, we cannot immediately commit to a large budget without seeing tangible results. We have various costs and expenses that require careful allocation. Once we observe that your work/effort is bringing us valuable results, we will gladly invest more in that direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We look forward to getting to know you and potentially collaborating with you soon.&lt;br /&gt;
