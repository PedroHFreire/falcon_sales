Hi &#128075;&#127996; My name&amp;#039;s Fiona and I run https://thewildpixel.com which is a business about Human Design. If you&amp;#039;ve never heard of it, imagine if astrology and Myers-Briggs had a love child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m starting a video blog, and I need someone to help me get through this content burst I&amp;#039;m going to have. I don&amp;#039;t imagine the tasks would take more than 1-2 hours per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the tasks will be:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Uploading my images to Instagram from Canva and/or editing my Canva templates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Copy and pasting Instagram hashtags and descriptions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Compressing my images for my blog posts and editing the blog posts. You&amp;#039;ll copy and paste the content, SEO, and add tags/categories (all will be given to you).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Uploading my videos to YouTube and Thinkific.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Scheduling my ConvertKit emails with the proper tags.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&#9888;&#65039; You MUST already know how to use that software.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Logistics:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- I will communicate through Upwork, sometimes sending Loom videos, but often through text.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- My budget is $150 per MONTH. I plan on using up as much of that as possible, so if I&amp;#039;m not giving you enough work to cover it, let me know! If you are working so quickly you&amp;#039;re unable to log much time, also let me know! We can increase your monthly so you&amp;#039;re compensated fairly. For example, if you take 1 hour to do a task that takes someone else 3 hours, it makes no sense for you to be making less money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Your screen will be recorded for at least the first two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Other:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is going to be a one-month trial just to make sure we work well together. We don&amp;#039;t discriminate against your gender identity, age, race, orientation, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All the love,&lt;br /&gt;
Fiona&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $15.00-$30.00
