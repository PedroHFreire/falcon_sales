I am seeking a Social Media Manager/Strategist with a proven record on Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, and YouTube. I need someone to post my videos five days a week to captivate and engage, drive conversions through a funnel that must be created. Here&amp;#039;s what I am looking for:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. Designing visually appealing reels, stories (45 seconds to 1 minute) with Cupcut and Canva that resonate with my audience. Utilize this video and content across all platforms.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Instagram Marketing: Maximizing impact with strategies and content that captivate on Instagram.&lt;br /&gt;
3. TikTok Marketing: Maximizing impact with strategies and content that captivate on TikTok.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Facebook Marketing: Similar strategies as above.&lt;br /&gt;
5. Content Writing &amp;amp;amp; Copywriting: Crafting compelling copy that engages and converts across all platforms.&lt;br /&gt;
6. Social Media Strategy: Developing strategies that align with your goals for a cohesive online presence.&lt;br /&gt;
7. Short-Form Video Editing: Optimizing Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts, TikToks with the latest trends for virality.&lt;br /&gt;
8. YouTube Management and Twitter/X (optional but beneficial): Optimizing profiles and creating engaging content to boost organic traffic and drive sales.&lt;br /&gt;
9. LinkedIn Management: Optimizing profiles and content to boost industry authority and enhance networking for an impactful presence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I require shorts, TikTok and Instagram Reels, Facebook, LinkedIn, and possibly Twitter/X content five days a week. My budget is $300 per week with a 10% marketing bonus every month from every sale that does not involve my current 35 participants. After three months, we can renegotiate the marketing bonuses if the business continues to grow and expand. This is a genuine opportunity for both you and the company to thrive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $300
