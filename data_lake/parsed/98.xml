No captions or voices need to be added to the videos; the focus is solely on capturing appealing footage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The primary objective of these videos is to introduce potential buyers to the properties.

- Video editing skills&lt;br /&gt;
- Creative storytelling abilities&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The ownership and copyright of the videos will be retained by the videographer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $100
