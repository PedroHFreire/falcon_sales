I have tried to convert them to other formats, but nothing has worked. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The job here is narrow: I will provide two examples of the files. You spend maybe an hour taking a look at them, and tell me whether they are just corrupted files that can&amp;#039;t be salvaged. Or, if they can be converted or otherwise made to work, how? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $25
