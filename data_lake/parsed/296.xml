Our videographer is out of the country at that time, and we need someone to fill his shoes for the event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need to get videos of angles, subjects, and things similar to the following videos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlTORpugs8w&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WIzHWxRJvis&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will have 2 competitors who need to be filmed, along with b-roll footage of other competitors, the venue, equipment, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need one videographer with one camera, preferably a Sony FX3 or something comparable with a gimbal and a rode mic with a dead cat. Having a set of wireless lav mics will come in handy for quick interview-type footage we can splice in between the action shots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We can provide all the equipment, but we would have to bring everything from California, so we prefer that you have comparable equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There is no need to edit the videos. We just need the raw footage, as we have an editing team. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please apply if you are available next Friday through Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $40.00-$75.00
