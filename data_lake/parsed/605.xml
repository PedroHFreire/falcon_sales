</description><ns0:encoded>We are looking for someone who can provide a 30-second teaching clip. This clip will be used in our marketing efforts in a larger video. You will not be required to actually teach anything. You are simply &amp;amp;quot;acting&amp;amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
We will provide a script that you can read through, even though your voice will not be used. You should be prepared to be standing in the video. The ideal candidate will be able to create a split screen or side-by-side type of video of themselves on one side and the text/course information that will be provided for this video on the other side. We only need a 30-second clip.&lt;br /&gt;
