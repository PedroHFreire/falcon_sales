Here&amp;#039;s the first iteration of the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EPLtf9nj7A&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have recordings of each clip, and I can re-record them as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The feedback I&amp;#039;m trying to address with the polish to the video it is too jammed in a short period, it doesn&amp;#039;t highlight enough of the pain we&amp;#039;re addressing, and the text + video at the same time is hard to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $1,000

We are looking for a &amp;amp;quot;get ready with me as we pack&amp;amp;quot; style video to post on our social media channel to have someone packing a suitcase or duffel back for the event. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose of this is to give a modern take on a &amp;amp;quot;what to pack&amp;amp;quot; list so the attendees know what they need to bring. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

My videos are mostly training and discussing news, strategies, and topics about e-commerce.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I already have a good quality audio mic, so you should not need a lot of audio editing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;d like to break up my videos so they aren&amp;#039;t so much of me in front of the camera.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I&amp;#039;d like to add more:&lt;br /&gt;
1 - graphics&lt;br /&gt;
2 - call outs, text amplifiers&lt;br /&gt;
3 - royalty free B-Roll and Graphics (strict here that it be royalty free)&lt;br /&gt;
4 - video cuts/edits if I make a mistake during my video, instead of starting over, I&amp;#039;ll just say something like &amp;amp;quot;cut, let me start that part over again&amp;amp;quot;, and allow you to edit as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I currently have a &amp;amp;quot;Headliner&amp;amp;quot; account that can be utilized to easily make shorts, etc, or you can make the shorts yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I will send examples of channels that I really like once you are selected as a finalist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m open to hourly or a fixed price per video, or more preferable, a fixed rate per month based on a specified number of videos or hours per month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
MOST IMPORTANT TO ME:&lt;br /&gt;
How fast are you?&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;If I send you an unedited video, can you have it complete and uploaded within 24-48 hours?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
