Project Overview: The goal is to record B-roll that captures the spirit and environment of each location and activity. Events include a variety of outdoor and indoor activities TBD, specifics of which will be provided closer to the dates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Technical Specifications:&lt;br /&gt;

- A mix of wide shots and close-ups to reflect diverse experiences.&lt;br /&gt;
- Audio capture for ambient sounds is essential, especially during tours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Logistics:&lt;br /&gt;
- The activities will be both outdoors and indoors, with exact meet-up times and locations confirmed closer to the date.&lt;br /&gt;
- We require dynamic footage capturing interactions, detailed shots of art and artifacts, and panoramic shots of venues.&lt;br /&gt;
- Raw footage should be transferred to a jump drive post-event; no editing required from your side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Timeline and Cost: Please indicate your availability for the mentioned dates and provide any preliminary costs associated with the shooting days. We aim to finalize details ASAP for smooth project coordination.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
