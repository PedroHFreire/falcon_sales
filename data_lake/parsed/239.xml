&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am an inspiring YouTube content creator with little to no time to promote my own content. I am currently working full time with a 1-year-old and just need some help with marketing and broadening the scope for my channel on TikTok, Twitch, and YouTube. I have not streamed for a while, but I would like to still be able to promote that channel, but more importantly, to gain more watch time and loyal followed viewers.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am currently at5.11k subs on YouTube with plenty of videos to promote. On Twitch I am only at 200 or so but, again, stopped streaming a while ago but wanting to be able to get back into it. On TikTok I have close to 1.1k followers with a little over 1.5k likes on my videos. &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am seeking someone who will be open minded to helping me grow and to better my future. By this, I do not mean editing my videos, however that may come down the line, but rather promoting by channel with all Seo marketing along with more advance tactics to grow subscribers and watch time that is from legitimate sources. &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I would like to ask anybody interested in my journey to be intrigued as opposed to helping for the money. Of course, I would be willing to pay for my success but would also like to be treated with respect, as I will treat you with respect as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What I would expect is to be able to receive help to finally get my foot in the door and start having loyal followers. My niche involves a field that is already highly populated but this what I want to do and what I feel I am best at. That being said, others have walked the path to success following the same goals and standards set for themselves, as will I. Best practice involves asking others who have been successful in the past and present in order to guide me to success for both our futures.&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $80

</description><ns0:encoded>Hello All, &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am an inspiring YouTube content creator with little to no time to promote my own content. I am currently working full time with a 1-year-old and just need some help with marketing and broadening the scope for my channel on TikTok, Twitch, and YouTube. I have not streamed for a while, but I would like to still be able to promote that channel, but more importantly, to gain more watch time and loyal followed viewers.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am currently at5.11k subs on YouTube with plenty of videos to promote. On Twitch I am only at 200 or so but, again, stopped streaming a while ago but wanting to be able to get back into it. On TikTok I have close to 1.1k followers with a little over 1.5k likes on my videos. &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I am seeking someone who will be open minded to helping me grow and to better my future. By this, I do not mean editing my videos, however that may come down the line, but rather promoting by channel with all Seo marketing along with more advance tactics to grow subscribers and watch time that is from legitimate sources. &lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;I would like to ask anybody interested in my journey to be intrigued as opposed to helping for the money. Of course, I would be willing to pay for my success but would also like to be treated with respect, as I will treat you with respect as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;What I would expect is to be able to receive help to finally get my foot in the door and start having loyal followers. My niche involves a field that is already highly populated but this what I want to do and what I feel I am best at. That being said, others have walked the path to success following the same goals and standards set for themselves, as will I. Best practice involves asking others who have been successful in the past and present in order to guide me to success for both our futures.&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $80
