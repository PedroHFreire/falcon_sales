We work mostly in the fintech, AI, blockchain, and innovation space and will have minor to major projects that will involve a lot of content creation in said spaces and possibly more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need someone who can help us in executing said content i.e. need someone to support us in splicing up the content so that we have materials across all social media platforms that are branded and cool. We LOOOOVE working with AI toolks like Midjourney, RunwayML, ChatGPT (for captions) - so anyone who has been playing around with these would have plus points! If not, we can teach you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some sample tasks: One long-form interview video on youtube needs to be translated to an infographic on Instagram, thread on Twitter, quote cards on Facebook, etc. or basically create content for a month for particular brand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The ideal set-up would be we give you the raw materials (could be video/article/etc) and you edit them for the corresponding channels and &amp;#039;brand&amp;#039; it accordingly so it looks neat and sleek... But more importantly, on brand and on strat! You will also be working with creative and strategy supervision so don&amp;#039;t worry, you&amp;#039;ll have a tag team to guide you throughout the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Someone who can be on their toes for what&amp;#039;s trending, and what creative executions we can post up in our channels will be an advantage. Bonus points if you&amp;#039;re adept at paid ads strategy and overall social media management, too. Our channel stack so far includes: LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Substack. Might explore more in the future but this is where we start. &#128640;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Work may be constant as we will be churning out content constantly. The awesome other thing we can offer is you get to work with a cool bunch of fellow creative folks just living the decentralized, non-traditional, almost digital nomad approach to life. No office politics here! We&amp;#039;re geeks who likes AI, AI, AI!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That said- if you feel like you&amp;#039;d fit right in with us - do send in your proposal. Stellar candidates will be invited to the inner tribe of our talent base and will be given more project opportunities. &#128077;&#127996;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $5.00-$12.00

We&amp;#039;re a wellness/health ecommerce business looking for a bad-ass performance creative &amp;ndash; someone who can create both create great ad concepts AND turn those concepts into compelling ads (video or static) that drive results &amp;ndash; either by themselves entirely or with content from UGC creators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You&amp;#039;re a perfect fit, if:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ndash; You can spot a good Meta ad when you see one and tell what specifically makes it good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ndash; You understand consumer psychology and can create ads that drive results and not only look great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ndash; You&amp;#039;re comfortable overseeing the entire ad creation process (including coordinating content with creators), from conceptualisation to execution, with top-notch quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ndash; Creativity runs through your veins, but you&amp;#039;re also technical, able to navigate the intricacies of ad creation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;ndash; You&amp;#039;re adept at testing different ad concepts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What you can expect:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Your ads will be tested on Meta Ads. We will share with you all the statistics (3s watch rate, click rate etc) so you can improve your game (not based on opinions, but based on real data)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- You&amp;#039;ll be responsible for creating different ad concepts to identify what resonates best with our audience. From there, you&amp;#039;ll iterate and optimize to drive maximum conversions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- You will get some direction for ads, but we prioritise creativity and you bringing your own ideas &#128161;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- This is a dynamic role with access to budget for content creation as needed. You&amp;#039;ll have the freedom to bring your creative vision to life, whether that means creating ads entirely on your own or collaborating UGC creators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
THE JOB:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- We&amp;#039;re looking to start with around 5-7 hours a week. If it works out, we&amp;#039;re looking to extend to a long-term contract with more hours. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- This job is creating (mostly video) ads for Meta&amp;ndash;facebook, from conceptualising, coordinating with content creators (if needed); to delivering the final ad that&amp;#039;s ready to launch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Interested? Let&amp;#039;s chat! An ideal application should include examples of ads you created and your reasoning of why you made them that way and what you think makes them good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Looking forward to hearing from you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Downloading an mp4 file once it&amp;#039;s been edited by my video editor.&lt;br /&gt;

Watch the video&lt;br /&gt;
Write an SEO optimized and helpful description&lt;br /&gt;
Create chapters for videos over 5 minutes&lt;br /&gt;
Add tags&lt;br /&gt;
Add 1 hashtag&lt;br /&gt;

You will be given access to my course on YouTube SEO as part of this, and templates of previous thumbnails I had done, photos of me for the thumbnail, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I use a project management tool called &amp;amp;quot;Blue.cc&amp;amp;quot; and there is a whole process in place already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
