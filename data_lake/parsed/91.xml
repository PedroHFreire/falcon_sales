We are looking for a skilled individual or team to update and develop an AI-powered training video for our Enrollware data entry procedures. The goal is to replace our current video on YouTube with an updated version that includes specific enhancements and revisions. Video: https://youtu.be/NWaQTQf9N9o&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Scope of Work:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Script Writing: Develop an updated script for our Enrollware data entry training video. The script should mirror our current video while incorporating the following updates:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Update instructions on how to input a course location correctly at (1:54) and (2:02), using the comments section to help instructors stay organized.&lt;br /&gt;
Introduce the types of course documents required under the documents section before (2:34): Online Blended Learning Completion Certificates, Skill Sheets, and Written Exam Answer Sheets.&lt;br /&gt;
Update instructions for entering a written exam score for AHA courses:&lt;br /&gt;
For courses requiring a written exam (e.g., BLS, ACLS, PALS, ASLS), specify entering &amp;amp;quot;Complete&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;Incomplete&amp;amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
For AHA Courses without a written exam (e.g., Heartsaver CPRAED First Aid), provide specific instructions.&lt;br /&gt;
Specify that the following documents are required to be kept on file for a minimum of three years per course: Roster, Skills Sheets, Written Exam Answer Sheet, Blended Learning Completion Certificates.&lt;br /&gt;
Add a new section at (3:18) detailing &amp;amp;quot;How to issue eCards&amp;amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Divide the video at 3:25 into two segments: one designed for Training Sites and another continuing the instructional flow.&lt;br /&gt;
AI Video Development: Utilize AI technology to create the updated training video based on the revised script. The video should be engaging, professional, and suitable for uploading to YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Deliverables:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Revised script for the Enrollware data entry training video.&lt;br /&gt;
AI-generated training video incorporating the script revisions, segmented as specified.&lt;br /&gt;
Video format suitable for uploading to YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;

</description><ns0:encoded>Overview:&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking for a skilled individual or team to update and develop an AI-powered training video for our Enrollware data entry procedures. The goal is to replace our current video on YouTube with an updated version that includes specific enhancements and revisions. Video: https://youtu.be/NWaQTQf9N9o&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Scope of Work:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Script Writing: Develop an updated script for our Enrollware data entry training video. The script should mirror our current video while incorporating the following updates:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Update instructions on how to input a course location correctly at (1:54) and (2:02), using the comments section to help instructors stay organized.&lt;br /&gt;
Introduce the types of course documents required under the documents section before (2:34): Online Blended Learning Completion Certificates, Skill Sheets, and Written Exam Answer Sheets.&lt;br /&gt;
Update instructions for entering a written exam score for AHA courses:&lt;br /&gt;
For courses requiring a written exam (e.g., BLS, ACLS, PALS, ASLS), specify entering &amp;amp;quot;Complete&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;Incomplete&amp;amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
For AHA Courses without a written exam (e.g., Heartsaver CPRAED First Aid), provide specific instructions.&lt;br /&gt;
Specify that the following documents are required to be kept on file for a minimum of three years per course: Roster, Skills Sheets, Written Exam Answer Sheet, Blended Learning Completion Certificates.&lt;br /&gt;
Add a new section at (3:18) detailing &amp;amp;quot;How to issue eCards&amp;amp;quot;.&lt;br /&gt;
Divide the video at 3:25 into two segments: one designed for Training Sites and another continuing the instructional flow.&lt;br /&gt;
AI Video Development: Utilize AI technology to create the updated training video based on the revised script. The video should be engaging, professional, and suitable for uploading to YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Deliverables:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Revised script for the Enrollware data entry training video.&lt;br /&gt;
AI-generated training video incorporating the script revisions, segmented as specified.&lt;br /&gt;
Video format suitable for uploading to YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;
