One video is a franchise offering video, from around 3-5 minutes long. The other is a testimonial video about our company that is at most 1 minute long. Both videos will need editing. Both videos will be shot at 1 location anywhere between 2-5 hours of shooting. If you can travel multiple states in the US for $1,000 total that would be great. If not, where would you be able to shoot for that price?&lt;br /&gt;

Sometimes our clients want voiceover and sometimes they are able to speak the whole video themselves. Would this be an extra cost? &lt;br /&gt;
