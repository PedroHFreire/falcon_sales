We are looking to hire a skilled video editor to create exciting and engaging final videos from refined footage of our recent paving jobs at three different locations. The goal is to produce content that follows best practices for Instagram Reels and maximizes the chances of the clips going viral.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are the details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Project: Create final videos from refined footage of three paving jobs. The footage for each job is clearly labelled as intro/outtro, along with the different stages of work captured in each clip. Stage 1= first stage, and the stage with the highest number is the last stage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Objective: Make the content exciting and engaging, following best practices for IG Reels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Length: Each reel should be approx 1 minute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
Use the provided footage to create a captivating video.&lt;br /&gt;
Ensure the video is optimized for IG Reels.&lt;br /&gt;
Highlight key moments of the paving jobs. Make it engaging and fun!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are testing the skills of 3 different video editors- and will be going with the best one. One individual will receive an ongoing contract with us, as we always have new footage which requires editing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are links to the refined footage:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We currently have 2 full-time editors who are doing amazing work for us but they are getting bogged down with the amount of videos we need to produce at any given time - time to expand the team!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
They currently use Adobe Premiere Pro and we would prefer to keep this consistent for collaboration purposes. If you prefer another tool, we can talk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Who We Need:&lt;br /&gt;
- AVAILABILITY -- We&amp;#039;re looking to bring on someone who has plenty of room in their day-to-day work to take on extra projects. If you&amp;#039;re already pretty full with work, this is NOT the opportunity for you.&lt;br /&gt;
- SPEED -- Speed is crucial. We are aiming to launch new Meta and YouTube Ads weekly and that&amp;#039;s not counting the organic video content we produce on a regular basis too. That said, turnaround time is very important to us. We need someone who can knock out 3-15 minute polished videos in just 1-2 days.&lt;br /&gt;
- COMMUNICATION -- This person needs to be a great communicator; someone who isn&amp;#039;t afraid of messaging us if they have questions or need additional resources.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our Business:&lt;br /&gt;
- We are Pioneering Clean (check us out at https://pioneeringclean.com/)&lt;br /&gt;
- We&amp;#039;ve already established a pretty good system using tools like Frame.io, Asana, and Slack but always looking for ways to improve and value our teams feedback.&lt;br /&gt;
- You won&amp;#039;t need to &amp;amp;quot;hold our hands&amp;amp;quot; like with other clients. We provide high quality video, audio, storyboards, b-roll footage, and more to give our editors everything they need to produce high-quality work.&lt;br /&gt;
- We specialize in the cleaning industry and produce ads and content around this topic. If you find this field boring, please do not apply!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Skills Required:&lt;br /&gt;
- Video Editing (Premiere Pro)&lt;br /&gt;
- Audio Optimization&lt;br /&gt;
- Custom Motion Graphics&lt;br /&gt;
- Graphic Design&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Summary &amp;amp;amp; Additional Notes:&lt;br /&gt;
- If you have an amazing work ethic and great video editing skills, let&amp;#039;s chat!&lt;br /&gt;
- Only custom, personalized proposals please... Any &amp;#039;copy &amp;amp;amp; paste&amp;#039; proposals will be IGNORED! We care about our team members and want our team to care about us and our business.&lt;br /&gt;
- In fact, to show that you&amp;#039;re reading all of this, please include the word &amp;#039;Pioneer&amp;#039; somewhere in your proposal ;)&lt;br /&gt;
- Communication is key. Tons of revisions are not good! We expect 1-3 but more revisions than that really delays the process. Therefore, it&amp;#039;s important to ask questions along the way if needed.&lt;br /&gt;
- SPEED is essential! If you love editing but it takes you several days to produce a 3-5 minute video, this may not be the position for you (yet). That said, the 2 editors we have now both started out at an intermediate level and we now consider them expert editors - they grew into the position and we are happy to support anyone else who can do the same!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In short, if you LOVE video editing and want to be a part of a growing organization, then we encourage you to submit a personalized proposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;#039;re thinking that one more team member would suffice but are not opposed to hiring 2-3 total so please don&amp;#039;t shy away from submitting your proposal. If the post is still published then we&amp;#039;re still hiring! The second we fill these spots, we will take down the job post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you for your time and attention - we look forward to your proposals :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I switched to Push Training for personalized treadmill workouts, and the results are incredible.&lt;br /&gt;
(Creator running on a treadmill on a higher speed + Vo) I&amp;#039;ve been hitting new personal records.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

(Creator running on a treadmill on a higher speed + Vo) I&amp;#039;m running longer distances&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
