I cannot send an example because have not seen any videos like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please please please do not contact me unless you read this description fully and understand what the project is about. It is NOT a cash cow or whatever!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
No AI, no stock footage. Real movie clips and real music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Idea is to have lots of short videos, not shorts and lots of YouTube channels, maybe with just 1 video&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Example of 1 video title is,&amp;#039; Can my phone hurt me?&amp;#039;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Video opens with a movie clip of people saying yes yes yes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Brief text explaining why and how, Voice-over after giving people time to read the text.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
End video with some music&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Every video will have explanatory text and links to campaigning websites with lots of research to back up the video and verify information. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Idea is the videos are shocking, dramatic and with a touch of humour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;#039;s a controversial topic; I have spent the last 2 years researching it and it has been traumatic finding out the real truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Man made electromagnetic radiation is NOT as safe as the lying industry and their pet scientist would have people believe. There are over 2000 solid, peer-reviewed studies clearly showing harmful biological effects for every living organism on our planet. Regulatory authorities completely ignore this research. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Never in the history of science has so much evidence been Ignored and dismissed . &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Environmental Health Trust sued the FCC for ignoring scientific research showing harmful effects including cancer and they won the case. The judge rebuked the FCC for not considering ALL of the available research and told them to do that but so far they have not. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please check out the Environmental Health Trust website to give you a good background of the project. The videos on it are usually too long, they speak while showing text and or they are too scientific for the man in the street.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The main objective is to wake people up that their phones are not completely safe and to advise them not to keep the phone close to their body. There has been a dramatic rise in cancers among younger people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks for reading this far. Please do not contact me with information about how good you are, what programs you use, I haven&amp;#039;t got a clue anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

anybody with 1 day of editing experience can do this &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
i am willing to spend 1$ per 2 videos and will have lots of videos you can do. 1 video should not take more then 2 minutes to make so you can earn 20$ an hour easily &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Many of the videos just need to be cut so that the dialogue is fluent and smooth. There will be approximately 30 videos altogether with scripts to guide you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Video lengths will be 2 minutes to 10 minutes each. Most are under 5 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I will want an editor that uses Premiere Pro so that I can get the final project files to continue to add the visuals that need to be added on my end. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
