Our script it attached and backing music will be provided.&lt;br /&gt;
We prefer to use (ideally) a young (20 something or so) african american male voice if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need a video like the reference provided but that aligns more with our message of sharing God&amp;#039;s light and letting yourself SHINE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This will be played in a theatre for a teen audience and presented as the opening sequence for the weekend motivational event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Each audience member will be wearing an LED bracelet which we will be programming along with the message to connect them even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Concept:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The theatre will start in blackness.&lt;br /&gt;
The video similar to the referenece will play (powerful visuals, narration and audio) using the script and music provided.&lt;br /&gt;
Then (and we&amp;#039;re open to your creative input) - we think it would be cool after the powerful last line of the script &amp;amp;quot;TONIGHT.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;LET.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;US.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SHINE&amp;amp;quot; if the theatre went black again and just the sound of a heartbeat started, with the bracelets beating along with the heart, or maybe a visual countdown on a black screen to the event starting with the bracelets beating along with the countdown timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Looking for your ideas on how to make this the best it can be.&lt;br /&gt;

</description><ns0:encoded>Looking to create a video like this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkxXQLsDjXw&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our script it attached and backing music will be provided.&lt;br /&gt;
We prefer to use (ideally) a young (20 something or so) african american male voice if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need a video like the reference provided but that aligns more with our message of sharing God&amp;#039;s light and letting yourself SHINE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This will be played in a theatre for a teen audience and presented as the opening sequence for the weekend motivational event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Each audience member will be wearing an LED bracelet which we will be programming along with the message to connect them even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Concept:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The theatre will start in blackness.&lt;br /&gt;
The video similar to the referenece will play (powerful visuals, narration and audio) using the script and music provided.&lt;br /&gt;
Then (and we&amp;#039;re open to your creative input) - we think it would be cool after the powerful last line of the script &amp;amp;quot;TONIGHT.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;LET.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;US.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;SHINE&amp;amp;quot; if the theatre went black again and just the sound of a heartbeat started, with the bracelets beating along with the heart, or maybe a visual countdown on a black screen to the event starting with the bracelets beating along with the countdown timer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Looking for your ideas on how to make this the best it can be.&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 22, 2024 16:01 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Audio Editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:Audio Production,     Audio Editing,     Voice-Over
