Our ministry needs to edit 21 videos a week. This is a combination of shorts, medium, and long form content. Captioning is required with proper English grammar and active word highlight is preferred. SRT/VTT files for captions are a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will provide our Brand Standards document for colors, fonts, and general guidelines. Keyword, Hashtags, Titles, and Descriptions would be extremely beneficial. AI edited clips will not be accepted or paid for. Limited AI B-roll content is acceptable with rights to redistribute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All editing must be in Premier Pro and must provide the Premier Pro files and have license to redistribute additional content (B-roll, effects, music) used in the videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We shoot using 3 different cameras and as much as we try to control lighting, it is different on all three so you must be good at color matching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 - Shorts must be edited to fit all short form platforms in 9:16 aspect ratio, splicing content to be the most engaging form. Our ideal video length is 25-37 seconds. This will be the bulk of the work as we are posting 15 - 18 shorts per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Pulling short content from the medium and long form content will be required and will count towards the 15-18 short videos. Cliff hangers should be created to create a desire to click on the associated medium and long form content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 - Medium Content will need to fit platform requirements such as YT, Rumble, FB in 16:9 aspect ratio. Editing pauses and stumbles is required, but since video content is longer, less editing is needed on these videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 - Long Form Content. These are typically single camera podcast shots at the moment. We would like to change that up to get other shots as well but being that we want them to represent a live unedited format, the amount of editing on these is very little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $10.00-$25.00

My channel: https://www.youtube.com/@stephenchoi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My channel explores a variety of themes, including dating, relationships, building my coaching business, conversations with clients, and experiences as a nomadic entrepreneur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In terms of schedule, I&amp;#039;m looking to post at least 1 long-form video a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So far, I&amp;#039;ve mainly been doing talking head style videos, and I&amp;#039;m looking to also post street/indoor interviews and vlogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For talking head videos, I&amp;rsquo;m looking to replicate the style of my most recent video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pToXAT-6QQ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;rsquo;ll be great to add the editor&amp;rsquo;s unique creative touch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For the selection process, potential candidates will be asked to create a quick long-form video.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If hired, your responsibilities will include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. Editing A-roll footage to emphasize the most engaging segments.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Creating a compelling hook in the first 5-10 seconds to captivate viewers.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Integrating strategic B-roll and maintaining a lively pace to keep the audience engaged throughout.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Selecting appropriate royalty-free background music.&lt;br /&gt;
5. Utilizing your color grading skills for a professional finish (if applicable).&lt;br /&gt;
6. Producing 1-5 impactful YouTube Shorts (up to 1 minute each) from key moments in the full-length video.&lt;br /&gt;
7. (For interview videos), chopping the long-form and turning it into most impactful short-form videos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;#039;re interested, please send your portfolio along with your top work samples that align with my channel&amp;#039;s content and highlight your video editing skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Looking forward!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $400

We&amp;rsquo;re not a new agency; we&amp;#039;ve been around for almost three years. Previous candidates I&amp;rsquo;ve hired from sites like Upwork have received promotions and pay raises after consistently good job performance. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&#128276; Preferences&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Candidates who implement social media video best practices, such as attention-grabbing thumbnails and transitions that match audio and/or use trending sounds, will also receive priority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Don&amp;#039;t worry if you don&amp;#039;t know that because full training will also be provided.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&#9989;Comfortable using Adobe Premier Pro and Aftereffects or equivalent &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&#9989;Coachable and willing to learn and improve&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&#9989;Creative and able to think of solutions independently&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&#9989;Ability to implement visual effects, colour grading, transitions &amp;amp;amp; sound effects&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&#128276; Compensation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&#128176;Compensation ranges from $5 - $20 per video, depending on the complexity/length.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&#128176;We will also provide a one-off bonus of $100 if you provide a great service and our client stays beyond 6 months &#128526; (which happens quite often!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&#128176;There are also ad-hoc opportunities for one-off bonuses I.E $10 to create a sample post for a potential new client&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&#128276; Benefits for you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&#128640;100% remote working, we don&amp;#039;t care where you&amp;#039;re as long as you get the work done :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&#128640;An experienced line manager who&amp;#039;ll be on hand to support you in delivering results for your client&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&#128640;Bonuses to reward good performance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
