There are also distortions to logos and patterns on the clothing. The proportion of some body parts such as forearms is also not ideal. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What I&amp;rsquo;m looking for: someone who can edit the generated result in accordance with the reference image so that the logos, body movements, and facial expressions are as close as possible to 100% authenticity as if the video was taken in real life. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In the attachment, you find the generated result, the reference image, and the &amp;lsquo;expected&amp;rsquo; result. The expected results were given by CGI colleagues but I believe we can get closer to authenticity. I&amp;rsquo;m also seeking someone who knows what authenticity means so we don&amp;rsquo;t need endless revisions. Everything should be as close as possible to the provided reference images (all details on the shirt, face,&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;hands, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To clarify, we are looking for a long-term relationship were you would be able to transform the generated AI result into a commercially usable product on a large scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please be honest and let me know if human animations/images are possible since this requires a specific skill set and what pricing can be expected. This is a huge opportunity. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Additionally we would also need you to add some extra effects to the human animation (add backgrounds, add products, add visual effects, paste human animation in a different video background etc. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
PLEASE REACH OUT SO I CAN GIVE YOU MORE EXAMPLES&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Kind regards&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tasks for you are: 1. Fixing the hand distortions 2. Fixing the tattoo distortions 3. Fixing distortions to logos and patterns on the clothing 4. Adjusting any disproportional body parts 5. Improving the general authenticity of the human figure and movement in the video 6. (Optional) Crop out the human figure and paste it onto an image or video background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Example videos generated from our AI model are attached. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $15.00-$35.00

We are looking for very basic social media management.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Each account needs roughly 6 images and 1-2 reels posted every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will provide pre-selected images that need basic editing, spot removal, filter etc applied to them. You&amp;#039;re welcome to use FaceApp, but keep it will need to be subtle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Reels content requires basic editing of pre-selected videos into reels with appropriate music selection and well timed edits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In terms of growth / engagement it is not vital. Both accounts just need to be maintained rather than grown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We don&amp;#039;t anticipate that the work should take any more than 6-10 hours a month. Both accounts can share a lot of the same content. However posted in a different order. Details to be discussed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $5.00-$9.00
