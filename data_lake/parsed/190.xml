I am seeking color grading / colorization on a music video for a rock song (a single release). I took care to capture the best raw footage I could (shot on an Iphone 14 in ProRes / 4k mode), and am performing the rough edit of the video myself, but the final step of color grading is outside my expertise, so I&amp;#039;m seeking help in this area. I want the final product to look the best that it can, while being true to the style / concept of the video and song. I am seeking someone who is able to approach things not only in a technical way, but also creatively, in terms of finding what suits this video best, aesthetically. I would love to have a conversation about that with you, and hear your ideas / input.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If this seems like a project you would like to take on, or learn more about, please reach out! I&amp;#039;ve attached a few quick shots from the video in this post. Thank you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $300
