Job Description:&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m seeking a reliable video editor to produce engaging YouTube and TikTok shorts on a weekly basis. Your task will be to creatively combine audio clips I provide with visually engaging, copyright-free video content. This includes gameplay from Minecraft, ASMR-style destruction sequences, dynamic driving scenes from GTA, Subway Surfers gameplay, or any similar content that aligns with the tone of the audio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Responsibilities:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Select and edit video clips that complement the provided audio.&lt;br /&gt;
Use a video editor that supports auto-generated captions (e.g., CapCut).&lt;br /&gt;
Ensure captions accurately reflect the audio content and are perfectly timed.&lt;br /&gt;
Incorporate compelling clickbait titles or comments in the video.&lt;br /&gt;
Consistently deliver 7 videos every week at a predetermined time.&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Basic proficiency with video editing software, especially those with captioning features.&lt;br /&gt;
Good sense of timing and visual appeal to match audio and video content.&lt;br /&gt;
Ability to adhere to a weekly delivery schedule.&lt;br /&gt;
Entry-level experience in video editing; this task is straightforward and has been previously completed within an hour.&lt;br /&gt;
What I Offer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Consistent weekly work.&lt;br /&gt;
Clear instructions and expectations for each task.&lt;br /&gt;
Prompt and regular communication.&lt;br /&gt;
To Apply:&lt;br /&gt;
Please provide a brief overview of your experience with video editing, especially any work involving the synchronization of audio to video. Include a sample of a video you&amp;rsquo;ve edited, if possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This role is ideal for someone looking to earn some extra money on the side. It&amp;#039;s a straightforward task that&amp;#039;s both easy and quick, offering a fast way to supplement your income each week. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in a simple job that provides a steady little boost to your earnings, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $3.00-$5.00
