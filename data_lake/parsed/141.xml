Here&amp;#039;s an example of the type of videos I&amp;#039;m looking for. High energy with quick transitions and various video effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.instagram.com/p/C4qY1Y2tFng/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I will be attending and capturing content at these running related events myself and will work to immediately send the video files to you following each event (typically a weekday evening here in the US). In total, there will be 10-11 of these 30 second video edits needed over the course of two months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Two questions as I work to find the best fit for these edits:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-Do you have any experience editing running or fitness-related videos? If so, can you please share examples?&lt;br /&gt;
-How quickly do you estimate you could turn around a video edit if I provided all files immediately following an event?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;
