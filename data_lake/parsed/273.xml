</description><ns0:encoded>For a new YouTube channel, I am looking for a professional Quiz video editor who can make better videos than this channel: https://www.youtube.com/@CerebroLudico/videos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It will mainly be videos like &amp;#039;find the odd one out&amp;#039;. I want to start the channel in Spanish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Let me know what you can offer and what your price is.&lt;br /&gt;
- Script &lt;br /&gt;
- Video editing&lt;br /&gt;
- Thumbnail&lt;br /&gt;
- Voice&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Most of these videos on YouTube are around 9 minutes. I want a longer view duration, so I would like to have videos around 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The price is negotiable. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $30
