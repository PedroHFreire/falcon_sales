Create a series of social media shorts (stories) - vertical resolution - based on our main speakers comments in an interview.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Each separate video would be created on a new timeline in our shared project. You will have access to the rest of our project files and original timeline.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Because only Proxy files will be synced to you we will do the final color-grade in-house and provide final export. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have a transcript of the interview and it was shot with A and B cam. as well as folder of great B-roll. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need 12 social stories created from this project and the turnaround should be about 7-10 days. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We would like to see concepts of one first, with styling and music. Once the first is approved you can execute on the rest.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The idea is to create a cohesive series. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Subject matter is about social etiquette, party planning, and events. The main speaker is a book author and this series will help as a lead up to a new book launch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sample to our main video here: https://vimeo.com/clintbrewerphoto/review/968878735/58b1a67b11&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $10.00-$35.00

This will be in Norcross Ga. The event is Thursday, June 26th The arrival time for setup will be around 7:15pm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To clarify I am going to be shooting most of the main footage, you will be a B Cam operator, there is no editing involved, this will be an easy couple hours. I do not need a bunch of equipment, I will be there with my stuff, I just need a backup camera running, and for the B-Cam operating to be getting footage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $200
