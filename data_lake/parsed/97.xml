We are seeking a videographer to capture high-quality videos of real estate properties. The role involves creating short videos, approximately 2-3 minutes in length, featuring a realtor introducing the exterior and interior of each property. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For each appointment, the videographer will be responsible for shooting five videos, with the total compensation of $100. To ensure consistency, we require the videos to be of similar quality to the samples provided at the following links:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- [Sample Video 1]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qxv72vH9PAc?app=desktop&lt;br /&gt;
- [Sample Video 2]&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuK3YWsx10o&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
No captions or voices need to be added to the videos; the focus is solely on capturing appealing footage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The primary objective of these videos is to introduce potential buyers to the properties. Therefore, the videographer must possess experience in capturing the best angles and utilizing appropriate lighting techniques to showcase the property&amp;#039;s features.

Required Skills:&lt;br /&gt;

- Strong attention to detail&lt;br /&gt;
- Video editing skills&lt;br /&gt;
- Creative storytelling abilities&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
