These are the languages we need now:&lt;br /&gt;
Tamil, Telugu, Russian, Cantonese, Mandarin, Turkish, Portuguese (Portugal), Italian, Spanish (Only from Spain - don&amp;#039;t apply if you are native from Latin America) (Native only!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please check the PDF file for more details.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
**** Do not apply if your accent is not native to these regions, as your videos may be rejected, and you could lose all your work. The positions for ENGLISH language are FILLED! ****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Job Description:&lt;br /&gt;
We wanted to share a project that our company is working on with Adobe, which involves crowdsourcing people for a video/audio AI project. It&amp;#039;s a fun project where all you must do is record yourself answering some questions and upload the videos to a Google Drive. This project involves you recording up to 10 videos of yourself on your phone and answering a few simple questions. It will take 20 - 30 minutes to complete.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please note that it may take 80 to 90 days to receive payment for&lt;br /&gt;
this job, after evaluation and approval of the videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As long as you use a modern phone with 4K video, follow the directions, record in 4K and 60 FPS, your video(s) should be approved and you will be paid for each video. As well, if your video is approved, you won&amp;rsquo;t have to submit more recordings. Your uploaded videos will be accepted as the final files, so submit up to 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The purpose of this project is to provide training data for AI Voice models from real people in everyday settings. Your video and audio will not be used to create a clone or replication and will not be seen or heard by anyone outside of Voxpe or the client.&lt;br /&gt;
Watch this video for a quick walkthrough of how to record yourself with the correct specifications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If any of your friends and family members would like to participate in this project just let me know!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
