The channel is about Bible stories, you can get an idea of the type of thumbnails you will be making by looking at one of our competitors. &lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/@BibleStories.official&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The price per video is $10 for two AI generated thumbnails. A bonus will be provided if the video performs well. You will be given direction on the type of thumbnails we are after, with up to two rounds of revisions. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking to produce 3 videos per week, with an initial contract length of one month. We are looking for a long term relationship if things go well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Important qualities for the role&lt;br /&gt;

 - Understanding of Canva and/or Photoshop for edits&lt;br /&gt;
 - Understand viewer psychology and what goes behind the click. (Balance, composition, colors, emotion, etc)&lt;br /&gt;

Please provide example of High CTR thumbnails you have produced, ideally AI generated thumbnails. If thumbnails are not AI generated, please provide a separate example of AI art you have done. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Fluent English is a must for the role, as we will be communicating ideas back and forth. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

These video clips will need to be added together and combined with b-roll footage. Some clips will need simple trimming at the start or end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The final videos are quite short, less than 2 minutes in length. X3&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have sorted the video clips in order to be added together.&lt;br /&gt;
I have also compiled a variety of our B-roll footage for you to choose when splicing together footage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The b-roll footage will still have the agent audio overtop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You may add a subtle background audio if you like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All videos will end with our closing logo. Included with other video samples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
