Job Overview:&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;#039;re looking for a dynamic videographer to shoot, edit, and produce a 20-30 minute videocast featuring two thought leaders discussing Generative AI in the Enterprise. This project will be fast-paced, edgy, and creatively demanding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What You&amp;#039;ll Do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Conduct a 1-2 hour video shoot in Chicago (Address TBD).&lt;br /&gt;
Record a videocast with a bit of movement&amp;mdash;think podcast meets TED Talk with some arm-waving and room-walking. &lt;br /&gt;
Will take one or two cameras; mostly stationary (won&amp;#039;t need two cameras moving). &lt;br /&gt;
Edit the footage into a bold, punchy 20-30 minute videocast.&lt;br /&gt;
Include supers, study data cut-ins (images provided), branded intro and outro (logos, etc., provided), and engaging video effects and sounds.&lt;br /&gt;
Work improvisationally and fast, adapting and contributing creative ideas.&lt;br /&gt;
Complete the shoot, including setup and load out, within 3 hours. Editing should be around 8 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Proven experience in video shooting and editing.&lt;br /&gt;
We aren&amp;#039;t looking for someone with 75 years of experience.... &lt;br /&gt;
We want to work with people who come in ready to try new things.&lt;br /&gt;
Ability to produce high-energy, visually appealing content.&lt;br /&gt;
Quick adaptability and strong creative input.&lt;br /&gt;
Comfortable with fast-paced, improvisational work.&lt;br /&gt;
If you have any specific questions, please contact Siddhi at siddhi.pradhan@ascendion.com. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our Style:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are from Ascendion (a global AI-first software engineering services company). &lt;br /&gt;
We work fast and expect quick turnarounds.&lt;br /&gt;
We WANT to try&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;new things and improvise on the spot.&lt;br /&gt;
Two rounds of feedback max, with the final video ready within 7-8 days post-shoot.&lt;br /&gt;
If you&amp;#039;re up for a provocative, edgy, and fun project, we want to hear from you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $25.00-$50.00
