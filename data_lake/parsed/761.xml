I will provide the script and audio. The hired person must refer to the script and use AI prompts to create video for each scene in the script. Each scene should be 3 - 7 seconds. The total duration of the scenes must match the audio duration. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Character appearance and their outfits (depending on the storyline) must be consistent. You may use AI tools such as Leonardo AI, MidJourney and/or Pika to create the video scenes. You must have access to these tools already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
After creating the video scenes, you will need to video edit them to create a smooth video, and add in the audio for the script and ensure the narration matches the scenes and script. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Each project must be completed within 1 week but I&amp;#039;m open to negotiation if more time is needed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a new channel and I expect to post 1 anime video per week so it is a long term collaboration if you are able to meet the requirements of the project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
