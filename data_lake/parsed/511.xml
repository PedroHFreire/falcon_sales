We need a pro that can help us preparing primarily video mockups with motion like the following one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We will provide the video as well as the content (image of video as well) that should be shown on the green screens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Should be able to do with key effect tracker?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Would be cool if you have done it before and provide examples in your portfolio. We will have more interactive things on our new page, so I guess like 5-8 videos like that for now. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The project budget should be for 5 videos like that. If this is too high or low, just write me about it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $50

The Video Sales Letter (VSL) is designed to close potential customers by having them book a call with us while watching it.

These will be uploaded to Google Drive. Any access to other software can be provided by us, such as captioning software, royalty-free b-roll sites, and editing software like; Adobe Premiere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking for the most engaging, professional, and exciting video to be created. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
All those considered for the position will get paid to perform a test video of only a 2-minute edit. Whoever performs the best edit will get the project offered to them. The 2-minute demo will pay $40 for your time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The perfect professional would know how to edit video/audio in a professional manner as well as make the content engaging. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There is potential for consistent work if this project is done well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $300
