Light color grading needed. No music. I am thinking 1 video that is 60 seconds long and then a couple smaller videos of 15 seconds. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am looking for deliverables that are formatted for website use as well as social media use. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Also - I am looking to see if it possible to remove objects from the video. Specifically 2 pool floats that are laying on the lawn and perhaps a person standing in some of the clips. Can these be removed? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have a sample clip for you to look at. I can&amp;#039;t attach it to this job listing because it is larger then the 100mb size limit. Once you message regarding this job listing I can share a dropbox link. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a single job as of right now but hoping to create an ongoing business relationship for future drone video work as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $33.00-$85.00
