We do video production for US clients and are looking for an art director to join our team, either project-based or full-time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We call it an &amp;amp;quot;art director,&amp;amp;quot; but we&amp;#039;re essentially looking for someone who has the skills to transform a brief or a script into something visually stunning. This person should be able to develop video concepts (stories), draw storyboards, and illustrate them. Although Adobe Illustrator (or any other drawing software) is the main tool for illustration, this job also requires proficiency in After Effects. We often need to modify and design on top of templates, and it&amp;#039;s efficient to stay within After Effects to make the most of its tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Things you&amp;#039;ll be doing on a daily basis:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Defining the visual styles of the videos &amp;amp;amp; brand explorations&lt;br /&gt;
- Designing graphic packages for videos (intros, outros, lower thirds, transitions, titles, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
- Storyboards and illustrations&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking for someone with a video background who understands how animation works and agrees that the concept/storyline is the most important part when designing storyboards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please apply with a portfolio and show us how versatile you are as an artist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
