I have 3 video&amp;#039;s for products that need a bit more interesting editing, and need the current text to be translated from english into Dutch (you can use a translate tool for this). This project is a test, after this I have about 20 product video&amp;#039;s that need editing, and after that I need a part time editor (20hr per week) to edit instagram reeels and tiktok videos&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;ve attached the video&amp;#039;s that need to be edited and named them video #1, #2, #3 and added 1 example video of a video I think looks really good. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
comments:&lt;br /&gt;
For video #2, please delete the logo on the product on the right bottom corner, use a magic erase function for this so it does not look like the logo is there. &lt;br /&gt;
For video #3, erase the logo as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anything unclear? please contact me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $30
