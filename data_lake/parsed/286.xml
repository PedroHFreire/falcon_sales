It&amp;rsquo;s a pitch for an amendment to the U.S. Constitution, calling for a regular Constitutional Convention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My wife has recorded me giving the talk from my home office. However, on a parallel track, I need an Upwork contractor to produce: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1) relevant B-roll, including stock photos and/or footage, so there is visual variety and the audience doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to look at me reading a script on a continuous basis; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2) explanatory graphics in a few places, making it easier for the audience to understand such elements as how Convention delegates are selected and how amendment proposals are developed; and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3) a custom thumbnail featuring the title.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The contractor will then merge the graphics with the audio / video to create the final product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m not an expert on pricing a project like this, so please compete on price, as well as offering your proposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m happy to keep in touch via e-mail, phone, or video communications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Attached is the script. Here&amp;#039;s the link to a sample of my footage: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1txLGjdrlqoLixqChHa7BE4RTYc6NUxG1/view?usp=sharing &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It&amp;#039;s a low-resolution video.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A high-resolution file will be available later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $2,000

The client makes products that elevate the gifting experience. Think shredded paper, gift bags, bows, treat bags, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The ideal candidate should have a keen eye for visual storytelling and an understanding of current trends in content creation. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m starting with one small project that should be quite fast and straightforward. If this project works out, I have many more. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This first piece of content is a simple video demonstrating one of the products. It will include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-Demonstrating how to &amp;amp;quot;make&amp;amp;quot; the finished product,&lt;br /&gt;
-Step-by-step instructional text overlay&lt;br /&gt;
-Background music&lt;br /&gt;
-You can narrate the steps if you like, but not required. If you choose to narrate, DO NOT use a computer generated voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The finished product will be about 15 seconds. The client and I will provide feedback for 2 to 3 rounds of edits on things like music choice, caption editing, tone of voice, background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To be selected, please provide links to your video portfolio or links to 3 to 4 pieces of work you would like to showcase.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;We will quickly select the creators we want to move forward with and then provide product and reference samples of competitor videos. I do expect this project to move quite fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And like I said, we have a lot of video content to create, so ideally looking for someone we can engage regularly who becomes familiar with our product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $75
