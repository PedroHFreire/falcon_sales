We need a youthful, tiktok inspired dance style while keeping the moves simple enough to learn quickly. The audience is a group of teens ages 14-19 so a look and energy that would appeal to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Im looking for someone that has fast delivery times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The song is 4 mins but repetitive so you would redo the same moves for the choruses and repetitive lyrics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For filming, green screen is best if you have it. The most important thing is crisp contrast with the background and no shadows, so we can remove the background easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Full body&lt;br /&gt;
No shadows (proper lighting)&lt;br /&gt;
Contrasting clothing/skin/hair or hat etc with the background so there is a crisp border and background can be cut out easily&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We want the dance to be in a style like the Just Dance video game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-Using &amp;amp;quot;Literal&amp;amp;quot; moves with the lyrics (so where it says shine a light - the move should incorporate something that visually depicts this) as you can see in the example links attached. But with more style as the audience are aged 14-19 and familiar with tiktok dance styles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
 Also it will need to be mainly danced in place (some movement in each direction is fine but for the most part stationary since the teens will be learning and dancing this while standing together in a group.)&lt;br /&gt;
The moves should be clear and crisp so they are easy to follow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Heres some clips from just dance. The moves really depend on what goes with the song.&lt;br /&gt;
We want fun, tiktok style, not provocative. Repetitive moves and not too hard to learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwrFT0E_gO4&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Something that gives the feel of the just dance game style but is also easy to pick up on and anticipate the next moves after watching only a few times. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Looking for youthful style of clothes. Dancer needs to wear an outfit that is contrasting with background and skin as we will add video effects afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;
Many of the dancers for just dance wear bright wigs, cool hiphop dance outfits, fingerless gloves etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Regarding the song- here are some examples of people that have done choreography to this song before. These are pretty boring so we are hoping yours will have more style but you get the idea:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Currently, my short-form content consists of only talking head videos with captions (see attached video). In the attached example, I talk straight through, but I see places where words or sections could have been cut out to be more concise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My goal is to batch my recordings and then send them over to a video editor to save me time on editing so I can focus on content creation, writing captions, and sticking to a consistent posting schedule. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I don&amp;#039;t want the videos to look overproduced&amp;mdash;I just want simple editing as if I did it myself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;d really like to stop recording videos on the IG App, stop using filters, and record straight on my iPhone using Cinematic Mode. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That being said, I&amp;#039;ll be interested in changing the font of my captions to something more branded, improving lighting, and smoothing out my complexion, lol! I&amp;#039;m looking to create videos that are &amp;amp;quot;bright, white, and airy.&amp;amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m not looking to use any B Roll in short-form content. Each video will be published on 3 platforms-- IG Reels, Pinterest, and, very soon, YouTube Shorts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am going to start a YouTube channel in the next couple of months, so I&amp;#039;m also looking for someone skilled in long-form video editing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It would be great to have the same editor for both types of content for continuity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Again, I don&amp;#039;t want the long-form YouTube videos to look overproduced at first. A style that I like is https://www.youtube.com/@katie, although I will have less B-Roll to use at first. I don&amp;#039;t know if her videos are considered &amp;amp;quot;advanced editing&amp;amp;quot; or not. I&amp;#039;m not interested in doing &amp;amp;quot;vlog-style&amp;amp;quot; content right now. Just more of me talking to the camera with cuts to B Roll. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, I&amp;#039;m simply looking to take the editing off my plate. I am listing this job at an hourly rate, but I am definitely looking for someone who is efficient with their time. It would be good to have an average estimate of time/cost to edit each type of video. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Dominique&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $25.00-$40.00

</description><ns0:encoded>I am an Online Spanish Language Coach for Adults and am looking for a skilled video editor with a feminine touch to edit my short-form (and later long-form) video content. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Currently, my short-form content consists of only talking head videos with captions (see attached video). In the attached example, I talk straight through, but I see places where words or sections could have been cut out to be more concise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My goal is to batch my recordings and then send them over to a video editor to save me time on editing so I can focus on content creation, writing captions, and sticking to a consistent posting schedule. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I don&amp;#039;t want the videos to look overproduced&amp;mdash;I just want simple editing as if I did it myself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;d really like to stop recording videos on the IG App, stop using filters, and record straight on my iPhone using Cinematic Mode. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That being said, I&amp;#039;ll be interested in changing the font of my captions to something more branded, improving lighting, and smoothing out my complexion, lol! I&amp;#039;m looking to create videos that are &amp;amp;quot;bright, white, and airy.&amp;amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m not looking to use any B Roll in short-form content. Each video will be published on 3 platforms-- IG Reels, Pinterest, and, very soon, YouTube Shorts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am going to start a YouTube channel in the next couple of months, so I&amp;#039;m also looking for someone skilled in long-form video editing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It would be great to have the same editor for both types of content for continuity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Again, I don&amp;#039;t want the long-form YouTube videos to look overproduced at first. A style that I like is https://www.youtube.com/@katie, although I will have less B-Roll to use at first. I don&amp;#039;t know if her videos are considered &amp;amp;quot;advanced editing&amp;amp;quot; or not. I&amp;#039;m not interested in doing &amp;amp;quot;vlog-style&amp;amp;quot; content right now. Just more of me talking to the camera with cuts to B Roll. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, I&amp;#039;m simply looking to take the editing off my plate. I am listing this job at an hourly rate, but I am definitely looking for someone who is efficient with their time. It would be good to have an average estimate of time/cost to edit each type of video. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Dominique&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $25.00-$40.00
