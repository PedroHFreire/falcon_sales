</description><ns0:encoded>Video record walking around inside a Costco store. It should be similar to this video: https://youtu.be/aBynjSu8In8?si=5DllKCH0inxXk15H&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It should not be too busy inside the store (so recommend doing this on a Mon, Tues, Wed when store first opens).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Video-recording must meet following criteria:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Excellent stabilization&lt;br /&gt;
2) 4K at 60 fps&lt;br /&gt;
3) Video-Record in horizontal orientation&lt;br /&gt;
4) No video stuttering, ghosting (common if you use older gopro models; GoPro Hero12 works fine)&lt;br /&gt;
5) Last 10 minutes total&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
No talking, editing, or background music. I need just the video!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you for your consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $30
