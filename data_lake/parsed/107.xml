I am looking to spread positive, deep, truthful messages to the world via YouTube Shorts and I will need a editor to edit roughly 30seconds-1.15min videos of them suitable for YouTube Short. In a month we will aim to make 15 videos to start off and the monthly budget is $75 starting off. This will be a consistent and long-term position which may go on for years - I am looking for 1 dedicated person for this and I know the pay is not too great but I can only offer something reasonable for me right now but as we grow the compensation will as well. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
