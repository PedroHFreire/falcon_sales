Currently, my short-form content consists of only talking head videos with captions (see attached video). In the attached example, I talk straight through, but I see places where words or sections could have been cut out to be more concise. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My goal is to batch my recordings and then send them over to a video editor to save me time on editing so I can focus on content creation, writing captions, and sticking to a consistent posting schedule. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I don&amp;#039;t want the videos to look overproduced&amp;mdash;I just want simple editing as if I did it myself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;d really like to stop recording videos on the IG App, stop using filters, and record straight on my iPhone using Cinematic Mode. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That being said, I&amp;#039;ll be interested in changing the font of my captions to something more branded, improving lighting, and smoothing out my complexion, lol! I&amp;#039;m looking to create videos that are &amp;amp;quot;bright, white, and airy.&amp;amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m not looking to use any B Roll in short-form content. Each video will be published on 3 platforms-- IG Reels, Pinterest, and, very soon, YouTube Shorts. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am going to start a YouTube channel in the next couple of months, so I&amp;#039;m also looking for someone skilled in long-form video editing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It would be great to have the same editor for both types of content for continuity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Again, I don&amp;#039;t want the long-form YouTube videos to look overproduced at first. A style that I like is https://www.youtube.com/@katie, although I will have less B-Roll to use at first. I don&amp;#039;t know if her videos are considered &amp;amp;quot;advanced editing&amp;amp;quot; or not. I&amp;#039;m not interested in doing &amp;amp;quot;vlog-style&amp;amp;quot; content right now. Just more of me talking to the camera with cuts to B Roll. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, I&amp;#039;m simply looking to take the editing off my plate. I am listing this job at an hourly rate, but I am definitely looking for someone who is efficient with their time. It would be good to have an average estimate of time/cost to edit each type of video. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
