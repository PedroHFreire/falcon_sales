Many have titles like &amp;amp;quot;Top 5 Fishing Spots&amp;amp;quot; and I&amp;#039;m looking for an editor to take my already edited videos and turn them into multiple short-form videos for social media purposes. The editing needed is basic to intermediate, as each long-form video will be turned into shortened clips with a similar style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Turnaround time varies, but a minimum of two short-form videos per week is acceptable. I can provide the uploaded video from YouTube, the original videos, related pictures, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
REQUIRED SKILLS: Looking for an editor who can add some graphics and animations to grab the audience&amp;#039;s attention. Social media experience is preferable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Job Description: Edit one (1) video into ten (10) short videos for $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This job will start here, and could potentially turn into editing the long-form content in the future, if desired. Thanks!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $50

</description><ns0:encoded>I am a YouTube content creator, posting long-form fishing videos. Many have titles like &amp;amp;quot;Top 5 Fishing Spots&amp;amp;quot; and I&amp;#039;m looking for an editor to take my already edited videos and turn them into multiple short-form videos for social media purposes. The editing needed is basic to intermediate, as each long-form video will be turned into shortened clips with a similar style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Turnaround time varies, but a minimum of two short-form videos per week is acceptable. I can provide the uploaded video from YouTube, the original videos, related pictures, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
REQUIRED SKILLS: Looking for an editor who can add some graphics and animations to grab the audience&amp;#039;s attention. Social media experience is preferable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Job Description: Edit one (1) video into ten (10) short videos for $50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
