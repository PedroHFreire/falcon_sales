We are looking for a skilled video editor who can create shorts everyday for our brands. Basically Fcebook ads. (videos take max 20 min to make)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will give raw footage and you do your magic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some examples:&lt;br /&gt;

The hard part is not the editing as you see. Of course you need to have skills but the most important part is to make the video captivating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You need to do researches on which fonts to use best for fashion niches, which music is now trending and &amp;amp;quot;girly&amp;amp;quot;. You need to go on tiktok/instagram and search for fashion brands by yourself for inspiration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Add captions with emojis and stuff, as the first video linked above&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a BAD example: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1930vZgOueh7hVERuXHFuE6UOwGNBjCAM/view?usp=drive_link&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need the music to have ups and downs, beats , example see beat at 13s and notice how the music began low (trendy music btw):&lt;br /&gt;

If you&amp;#039;re ready to pop up 1 video with some variations a day (Monday to friday) and be paid 1000$/month, it would be awesome and glad to have you&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Send please your porfolio. Write &amp;amp;quot;fashion&amp;amp;quot; at the beginning so I know you read all&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $1,000
