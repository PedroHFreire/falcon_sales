Your task is to get as much of the interview to be stable as possible. Getting all of it stable is impossible, but the closer the better. If you&amp;#039;ve used Sony-specific software you may find that useful to include in the workflow, but it won&amp;#039;t be enough on its own. Below is a sample of the interview.
