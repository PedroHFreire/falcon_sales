Your job will be finding clips and pictures from the movies, and edit them in the video.&lt;br /&gt;
each segment should be relevant to what the voiceover is saying in that moment, to keep everything engaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I don&amp;#039;t need motion graphics or complicated things, I basically only need someone to trim sections from the movies (1080p, 60fps) and put them in the video as B roll, while maintaing somewhat the pacing of the voiceover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some parts of the video like the intro will already be edited by me, since I still want to be the one in charge of the more articulate things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some example of the editing I need.&lt;br /&gt;

</description><ns0:encoded>I have a Youtube channel in the filmmaking analysis niche&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Your job will be finding clips and pictures from the movies, and edit them in the video.&lt;br /&gt;
each segment should be relevant to what the voiceover is saying in that moment, to keep everything engaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I don&amp;#039;t need motion graphics or complicated things, I basically only need someone to trim sections from the movies (1080p, 60fps) and put them in the video as B roll, while maintaing somewhat the pacing of the voiceover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some parts of the video like the intro will already be edited by me, since I still want to be the one in charge of the more articulate things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some example of the editing I need.&lt;br /&gt;

Price can be discussed, so feel free to dm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $60
