Hello,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am in need of a Cinematic Video Editor, who is also good in music/audio editing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Your editing style must consist out of the editing elements (high quality clips, captions, and editing) as seen in the video in the attachments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We will provide the voice over and text.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are a brand that focuses on Stoic messages. Therefore the clips used must feel Stoic/ masculine (and always in accordance with what is being said in the speech)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Also our sample voice over is in there. You don&amp;#039;t have to use the whole voice-over, but 20-30 seconds at least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
let me know if you can!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Kind regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
