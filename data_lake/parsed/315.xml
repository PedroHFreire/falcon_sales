Must fit YouTube&amp;rsquo;s recommended size and resolution for cover photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Should include elements related to children&amp;#039;s content, such as cute vampires, superheroes, monsters, and other family-friendly themes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Should be visually appealing and professional to attract viewers and give a great first impression of the channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

It is designed to be a very comfortable slide that you can wear all day. On the beach, walking around, or after workouts. We would like an interesting animated video with REALISTIC rendering showing it&amp;rsquo;s properties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The 3D files have already been made and are here: &lt;br /&gt;

I am not very creative, so I would love your ideas on the video. I am only looking for 20-30 seconds at the very most. I don&amp;rsquo;t need any sound/music for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I would like to have something showing an exploded view (I will also need a still image of this for or print ads) of similar that emphasizes certain features of the shoe which are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
-TPEE (which is the material for the insole- the lighter color in each slide) and rubberized EVA (the darker color material in each, combined for shock absorption, energy return and stability&lt;br /&gt;
-Flexible carbon fiber X-plate (the piece below) keeps the sandal in contact with your foot, so there is no &amp;ldquo;snapping&amp;rdquo; when walking and it feels like more of an extension of your foot.&lt;br /&gt;
-Strategically placed vents for air flow and long term break in&lt;br /&gt;
-Convex dorsal strap in the toe box for more air flow and toe separation to help prevent athletes foot and plantar fasciatis&lt;br /&gt;
-Generous footbed with long, gentle flowing arch&lt;br /&gt;
-Footprint like outsole tread pattern for confident grip&lt;br /&gt;
-Designed by a board certified podiatrist&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Again, I am open to any ideas, but it is important to also emphasize that these are EXTREMELY comfortable and supportive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need the output in a format suitable for Youtube, Facebook and Instagram.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks. Please let me know if you have any questions at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
