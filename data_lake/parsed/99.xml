The app is intended to be a daily practice aid, drilling students on rhythm, theory, ear training, etc. I need someone to record videos of piano scales, chords, and arpeggios, for students to practice along with. There needs to be a metronome click sound (for all my erratic students, lol).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The candidate needs a strong understanding of piano technique.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Ideally you will also have an understanding of piano pedagogy. I have already set out a framework (see linked sheet and attached Technical Exercises) for what needs to be recorded, but I am open to adjustments, especially on the suggested tempi (each exercise will need to be recorded at multiple tempi). Skills in post production would be a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Sound and visuals need to be of high quality. I want an overhead view of the hands, like the attached image.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Price is negotiable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m excited to be moving one step closer to my dream of helping my piano students (and everyone) become fluent performers!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

- Adjust the background so that the turntable and background appear as a seamless, uniform surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The attached sample video should only show the ring and the turntable, with the background removed or adjusted so that it matches the color of the turntable, creating a uniform appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Since the turntable and background have different shades of white, it is essential to edit them so they visually match and appear as one consistent surface.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We currently have a total of twelve videos that need editing. I am going to send you one video to use as a sample when Inquiry. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Budget:&lt;br /&gt;
I have not set a fixed budget yet and would like to receive a price proposal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 16, 2024 23:43 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Video Editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:Video Editing,     3D Modeling,     Video Production,     Education,     Video Post-Editing
