You can think of the interview as the &amp;#039;raw materials&amp;#039; and the sequence of the conversation in the video might not be the same as in the final product. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
It would be helpful if you use and AI tool to get the transcript (eg. Descript) so that you can &amp;#039;see&amp;#039; all the main points being made and can remove anything that doesn&amp;#039;t make for awesome listening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The final product should be an engaging format, similar to a podcast that combines an intro and outro and audio elements throughout, such as music to draw the listener in and help them the listen longer. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The audience is women who want to change their lives by improving their English speaking confidence and fluency. We interview them to talk about their transformations after having joined our online English speaking-community for women (https://heylady.io)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I want that transformation to really shine through.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The biggest things that changed in their lives. The story of the challenges they overcame, and what opportunities they have created for themselves and their families now they can speak English more confidently and fluently. &lt;br /&gt;
The listener should be inspired by their story and believe she can follow in the footsteps of the woman being interviewed. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Think you have what it takes? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $10.00-$20.00
