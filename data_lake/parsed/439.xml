</description><ns0:encoded>I am a newly graduated medical doctor and I create animated video lectures on YouTube under the name &amp;amp;quot;Taim Talks Med.&amp;amp;quot; I am looking to design a new custom intro for my upcoming clinical videos, which will focus specifically on Cardiology. I already have an intro (please see the attached video), but I would like to create one that aligns more with the Cardiology theme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The new intro should maintain the simplicity of the current one, but feature the name &amp;amp;quot;Taim Talks Cardio.&amp;amp;quot; I have the vector file for the avatar used in the current intro available for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If this is a project you can assist with, I would love to hear from you. Additionally, I am open to any creative ideas you might have for the animation. &lt;br /&gt;
Please add an example of intros you&amp;#039;ve created as a reference if you have any. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
