I have dabbled with FinalCutPro a decade ago and started working with Premiere Pro about 5 years ago. I only edit videos for personal projects and do it so infrequently that I forget how to do things. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When importing clips, I am having problems with importing both the audio and video clips together. My program is old and has trouble importing video clips so we have to convert them. I also get lost with where to find clips I&amp;#039;ve imported, adding titles, adding music, etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am looking for someone who has patience and can help me make these videos. I am working on a train video, my grandson&amp;#039;s first 3 months video, a wildfire egress route video, and more! I would like you to help me make these videos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Are you interested? I am in Calif PST. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 25, 2024 00:49 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Video Editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:Data Entry,     Adobe Premiere Pro,     Video Production,     Video Editing,     VideoScribe,     Video Post-Editing,     Data Mining

I&amp;#039;ve linked a video below that is similar to what I&amp;#039;d like to achieve in my edits. I&amp;#039;ve spoken to some people who have noted how complicated this is, but I know the content creator who makes these uses CapCut and other similar apps. I personally use Final Cut or CapCut for most of my projects, so being able to pair with that one of those programs is preferred. Let me know what you think as this is out of my wheelhouse, but I&amp;#039;d like to incorporate this standard in my edits. Willing to negotiate prices! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks in advance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

</description><ns0:encoded>I&amp;#039;m a fitness coach and content creator in need of some expertise in the field of 3d rendering and layering, motion graphics, etc., specifically with anatomical layers for exercise demonstrations. I&amp;#039;ve linked a video below that is similar to what I&amp;#039;d like to achieve in my edits. I&amp;#039;ve spoken to some people who have noted how complicated this is, but I know the content creator who makes these uses CapCut and other similar apps. I personally use Final Cut or CapCut for most of my projects, so being able to pair with that one of those programs is preferred. Let me know what you think as this is out of my wheelhouse, but I&amp;#039;d like to incorporate this standard in my edits. Willing to negotiate prices! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks in advance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
