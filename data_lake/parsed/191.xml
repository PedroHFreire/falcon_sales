I have multiple projects going on right now that require editing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I manage two startup brands in the CPG space that will require occasional editing services for reels and ads. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In addition to this, I am also looking to increase my own personal online presence as a marketing and brand development professional. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I would love to talk with some people who have experience in this field. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Initially, it will be a price per project or hourly basis but as things get busier this will eventually turn into potential full-time employment. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I love to take content but I absolutely hate editing. The ideal work flow would be for me to upload weekly, clips and videos that we can work together to come up with strategies. I want the person who fills this role to understand what is currently trending in audio and visual styles. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As the relationship grows, the pay has the opportunity to increase. I set the budget as a placeholder. I am looking for someone with strong skills. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
