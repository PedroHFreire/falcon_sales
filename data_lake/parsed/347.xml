Create faceless videos for us!  - Upwork</title><link>https://www.upwork.com/jobs/UGC-Creators-Create-faceless-videos-for_%7E017ea3a549eab329b5?source=rss</link><description>Hello everyone,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I hope this post finds you well! I&amp;#039;m excited to share a new venture I&amp;#039;m launching&amp;mdash;a subscription service specifically designed to assist marketers with faceless marketing. The goal is to help them grow their accounts without the need for personal appearances in their content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
One of the most exciting aspects of this project is the opportunity to collaborate with talented video creators. I have always admired the creativity and aesthetic appeal of your videos, and I am eager to explore the possibility of working together on this initiative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
## What We&amp;#039;re Looking For&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are on the lookout for a set of aesthetically pleasing videos that we can resell as part of our subscription service. Specifically, we are interested in creating a set of 10 themed videos, each 10-15 seconds long. These videos will not feature your face but will instead focus on beautiful and engaging backgrounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
### Example Themes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here are some examples of the types of videos we&amp;#039;re interested in:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- [Example 1](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8ctKMwA9I0/?igsh=cTZubmM4NndzZW0w)&lt;br /&gt;
- [Example 2](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8cyBdVgKSP/?igsh=MW0xNWlreWU2ajNsMw==)&lt;br /&gt;
- [Example 3](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8WQ-BBS0zg/?igsh=NG9qMGoyaXN6cXll)&lt;br /&gt;
- [Example 4](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8LG1piP5bO/?igsh=MXA1djB4b3BwZGU3aA==)&lt;br /&gt;
- [Example 5](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8VCAI2ydGu/?igsh=OXFlN3JkNzB5Ynl0)&lt;br /&gt;
- [Example 6](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8St1qvA9y5/?igsh=c2E1bjZvN3cyYmx1)&lt;br /&gt;
- [Example 7](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8eeRJWAZ6Z/?igsh=OGRkd3NrYmJ4NWRo)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These examples showcase the kind of aesthetic and quality we&amp;#039;re aiming for. You can get as creative as you like, capturing scenes in a variety of settings such as a beach, coffee shop, bedroom, or while holding food. The goal is to have a diverse range of backgrounds in each pack.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
### How You Can Get Involved&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If this sounds like something you&amp;#039;d be interested in, we&amp;#039;d love to discuss it further with you. We believe this could be a fantastic opportunity to leverage your creative talents while contributing to a unique and innovative marketing service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please let us know if you&amp;#039;re interested in creating a set of 10 themed videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you, and I look forward to the possibility of collaborating!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

The clip is about printed zebra blinds. The video editor and me have some ideas about it, when you contant us i can show the ideas more exactly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
But short explanation: The beat from the song &amp;amp;quot;blue monday&amp;amp;quot;, which is also popular in social media reels, is someone which would fit. the kind of beat.&lt;br /&gt;
At the beginning different kind of images will be shown, always after a new beat. i tried to show it in a video to understand (attach).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Your job will be finding clips and pictures from the movies, and edit them in the video.&lt;br /&gt;
each segment should be relevant to what the voiceover is saying in that moment, to keep everything engaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I don&amp;#039;t need motion graphics or complicated things, I basically only need someone to trim sections from the movies (1080p, 60fps) and put them in the video as B roll, while maintaing somewhat the pacing of the voiceover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some parts of the video like the intro will already be edited by me, since I still want to be the one in charge of the more articulate things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some example of the editing I need.&lt;br /&gt;

</description><ns0:encoded>I have a Youtube channel in the filmmaking analysis niche&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Your job will be finding clips and pictures from the movies, and edit them in the video.&lt;br /&gt;
each segment should be relevant to what the voiceover is saying in that moment, to keep everything engaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
