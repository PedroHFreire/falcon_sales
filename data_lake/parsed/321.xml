I want to pay you to make 1 - 3 minute review videos of purchases / items you have ALREADY bought from Amazon :) All I need is the video and a single image of the item for the video thumbnail. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Considering the length of the videos (they shouldn&amp;#039;t take you more than a few minutes each max),I pay between $3-$5 per video depending on product category. If you can do 10/hour, that can be $30/hour or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
These will be items you have already purchased yourself from Amazon, that we will agree on together before you get started. Your task will then just be to film a simple, quick, and honest review video on your iPHone or smartphone (with specific guidelines), take a quick photo of the item for the video thumbnail, and send them to me for my review.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;You do NOT need to do any video editing, trimming, etc. Raw, honest, quick videos. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I will show you examples of what I want so there is no confusion and give you guidelines. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $30
