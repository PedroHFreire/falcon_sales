Each video is 2-5 minutes long.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;However the quality, volume and professionalism is not what it needs to be. We are seeking someone who has mastery over the Outlook subject matter, is extremely eloquent, with an American or Canadian accent, to recreate the videos.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;All five lessons will be provided (in Word format, as well as the original videos). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Lesson 1 provided is provided here for demonstrative purposes. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If this project is successful and on budget, we&amp;#039;d like to do a few additional lessons on Teams meetings (sound/video setup...) and then we can move on to our proprietary software. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $18.00-$24.00
