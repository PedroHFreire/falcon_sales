and many more...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To be transparent, I haven&amp;#039;t had the best of luck with previous hires for this role, and I am looking for people who are in it for the long run. I am happy with you doing even just 5 videos a day; that&amp;#039;s still an opportunity to make an extra $150 a month. And if you can make more than that, even better. Please understand hiring fees are really high, so I am looking for someone who can be dedicated to the project for at least two months. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I need the tutorials to be well-explained and thorough. I do have a few requirements;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. Have a PC/Laptop - most tutorials will be filmed here, some on mobile.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Have a decent microphone. A voice-over via your phone after the video has been recorded isn&amp;#039;t good enough; I find those videos aren&amp;#039;t in-depth enough.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Be able to film in a quiet environment. If this may be an issue, I can always recommend noise-canceling software. I would need you to test this before starting a contract to ensure it eliminates background noise.&lt;br /&gt;
4. Have a decent level of English that most people would understand without subtitles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have good and consistent work for those willing to do the work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I look forward to hearing from you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $10
