FBA, Amazon Advertising, Enhanced Brand Content, Amazon Support Cases, and optimization tools such as helium10. Junglescout, etc. &lt;br /&gt;
What I want to do is build out a portfolio of video recordings via loom or screen recordings. These would be short videos, only a few minutes max per each. No voice over required, I can do that later. Each video would cover a specific topic related to Amazon, such as &amp;amp;quot;How to Create a Product Title&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;How to Edit and optimize a Product title&amp;amp;quot; to more complex topics like &amp;amp;quot;how to work with amazon support to remove a policy violation&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;how to navigate pesticide issues&amp;amp;quot; or &amp;amp;quot;working with support on brand health issues&amp;amp;quot;.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The right candidate should already have experience doing these tasks, and they can record their screen as they would complete such tasks. Then the candidate would upload the video files to my server with a well labeled naming convention on folders, and upload a word document that clearly writes out all the steps taken in each video to complete the tasks.. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is a long term project, as my goal is to compile hundreds of such videos that I can then post to my company&amp;#039;s YouTube channel after I do some light video edits to get my branding in there. &lt;br /&gt;
I may also use these to create an &amp;amp;quot;Amazon Course&amp;amp;quot; at some point &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The candidate should be someone that is well organized, since we will need to keep track of videos created so we don&amp;#039;t duplicate work. Additionally, the documentation need sto be well written so that I can properly write out great video descriptions for YouTube SEO&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $4.00-$10.00

There are&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;2 objectives with this next job. The first objective is to create an animation with our logo to open and close all the videos we will be making moving forward. I&amp;rsquo;m not looking for anything too flashy. In the link below, I like the intro that our previous editor created. Check it out:&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y43LttiCNZQ&amp;amp;amp;t=21s&lt;br /&gt;
Perhaps provide us with a few examples for the open and close of a video to choose from. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The second object is to polish the 2 &amp;ldquo;Get a Quote&amp;rdquo; videos. Mostly&amp;hellip;add some music, intros and overlay the venue images when the girls name the locations: &amp;ldquo;All the Walter&amp;rsquo;s Estate Locations&amp;rdquo; ect&amp;hellip; (The filenames tell you the venue name.) One of the videos is greenscreen and needs to be keyed to white. (Possibly we may want a studio in the background. I&amp;rsquo;ll make that decision after I see the white.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;rsquo;m still waiting on the second video, but if you want to get going on the video you already have&amp;hellip;go for it. Here is the folder containing the venue images: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zkEZTgPtHFYk6klfK2PHDmZYOeZi_qjG?usp=sharing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Posted On&lt;/b&gt;: June 20, 2024 18:27 UTC&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Category&lt;/b&gt;: Video Editing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Skills&lt;/b&gt;:Video Editing

We are preparing to launch and developing video content to share on social media to support our marketing efforts. We had the privilege of setting up several of the top prospects in this upcoming NBA draft with our product. We filmed the session where we initially scanned their feet and shoes, and then we filmed the session where we handed off the product and watched them try it out. They response was extremely positive and we want to put together some videos using the footage we captured. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are seeking a skilled video editor to help us create high-quality highlight videos of NBA prospects using and reacting to our product. The editor will be responsible for taking raw video footage and transforming it into visually appealing and engaging highlight videos. The editor will also be responsible for editing the audio to boost dialogue clarity and minimize the sound of basketballs being dribbled. The ideal candidate will have experience in video editing, a good eye for storytelling through visuals, and a solid understanding of the NBA. Attention to detail and the ability to work with tight deadlines are essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have about 30 minutes of footage and are hoping to produce 5 highlight videos. One should be about a minute long and summarize the whole engagement. Another should be about 20 seconds long and highlight the successful response. The other three should also be short, and will be focused on specific interactions that were captured in the footage, that I can specify once the project is accepted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m hoping to have these completed by the end of this weekend and can pay up to $500 for the job. Preference will be given to those with demonstrated high-quality outputs and the ability to turn this around on a tight timeline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

- Video editing&lt;br /&gt;
- Visual storytelling&lt;br /&gt;
- Attention to detail&lt;br /&gt;
- NBA knowledge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $500
