I put something together on my own to crop it out, but the edges look rough and have a lot of green bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m looking for someone to take the clip that I have and do a better job of cropping out the green screen. I have a lot of these clips to do, so I would need the .kdenlive file at the end to use as a reference for the rest of the videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
