I&amp;rsquo;d record it again in French this time, and your goal would be to adapt the Adobe Premiere (2023 or 2024) project to the French recording (so edit effect timings mostly), replace the English recording, and translate the text on the screen to French.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I did it myself and it&amp;rsquo;s actually much easier than re editing everything I feel like. Of course synchronizing the new French recording takes time, but that&amp;rsquo;s all you gotta do and translate the sentences shown. It takes me like around 3 hours to do it and I&amp;rsquo;m not a professional editor like you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
So the goal is to:&lt;br /&gt;
0. open the 2023 file (download fonts before) to make sure it opens properly&lt;br /&gt;
1. Take the french recording and match with audio&lt;br /&gt;
2. make cuts to fit the script and remove retakes&lt;br /&gt;
3. replace english video with french and adjust effect timings&lt;br /&gt;
4. replace english text for french text on screen and ideally english content with french content&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Example video before and after translation:&lt;br /&gt;
English (original): (link removed)&lt;br /&gt;
French: (link removed)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $75

I put something together on my own to crop it out, but the edges look rough and have a lot of green bleed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m looking for someone to take the clip that I have and do a better job of cropping out the green screen. I have a lot of these clips to do, so I would need the .kdenlive file at the end to use as a reference for the rest of the videos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
