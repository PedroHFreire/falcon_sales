I am not looking for crazy over the top TikTok/YT shorts style editing, these are long-form faceless documentaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

</description><ns0:encoded>Hiring a video editor to edit podcasts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The candidate should have good knowledge of video editing and podcast editing. We only need 4-5 podcasts edited per month, and we are looking for simple editing. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The software we are using is Adobe Premiere Pro. There are no fixed working hours; we just need the projects delivered on time. A good PC with decent RAM is required since our video sizes are large, around 1 hour+ for each episode with 3 camera&amp;#039;s and 1 audio. We will provide the outro and intro.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Pay is $200 per month for this freelance gig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $200

For Amchara the focus is on home detox, how can one detox at home, what&amp;#039;s needed, advice etc. The monetisation will be consultations with me, purchasing of functional tests and potentailly online courses/programmes &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For Swandoola the content is business coaching for nutritionists, Doctors and other health clinic professionals who want to build their business and ironically this includes creating online content too. So part of my first business model is to show nutritionists how I do it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m looking for a long-term relationship with a video editing professional who might also be able to bring general marketing value though that is a different skill so might. be best suited to a separate person &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m looking to start this project in July. I look forward to meeting with you &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $10.00-$30.00
