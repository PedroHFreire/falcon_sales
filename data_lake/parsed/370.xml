I already have the scripts and voice overs and am only looking for a quality experienced editor to help me put it all together. You will be expected to find copyright free clips online and follow all copyright rules to ensure the video is claim free. I am looking for ONLY an experienced editor who is confident they can do this style and make the video look as professional as possible. We will be paying $5/ min of edit with most videos being 5-10 mins long and this will be a long term relationship/ project. I will be asking for a 30 second - 1 min sample from all editors to ensure we are not wasting each others time. Raises and bonuses will be awarded overtime and will be performance based. Thank you and have an amazing day! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
