We are seeking an expert video editor to enhance our football video content from basic to advanced editing levels. Your role involves creating football compilations based on specific titles and collaborating closely with our scriptwriter and Voice-Over (VO) artist to produce engaging content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Workflow:&lt;br /&gt;
Compilation Creation: Start by assembling a copyright-free football video compilation based on the given title. Retain the original sound of the clips without adding any original commentary or sound effects, as they will be replaced by our narrator&amp;rsquo;s voice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Script Development:&lt;br /&gt;
The video is then sent to our scriptwriter who will creatively detail each clip. The scriptwriter is adept at fitting the commentary to match the video timing. You may need to adjust the video by repeating scenes, slowing down clips, or cutting excessive commentary to match the script.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Voice-Over Integration:&lt;br /&gt;
After receiving the voice-over recording, your job is to finalize the video edit by ensuring the audio syncs perfectly with the video content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Personal Input: You are encouraged to contribute ideas to the script. This collaborative effort helps personalize our content, making our videos stand out and potentially increasing viewer engagement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Content Focus:&lt;br /&gt;
Our channel features videos on various football themes like &amp;amp;quot;Legendary Penalty Moments&amp;amp;quot; and &amp;amp;quot;Comedy Moments in Football.&amp;amp;quot; Each video typically runs for 8-9 minutes, focusing on delivering quality and engaging content.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Video Editing Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
- Adhere closely to specific instructions and creatively enhance each video.&lt;br /&gt;
- Efficiently source appropriate clips and strictly avoid any copyrighted material.&lt;br /&gt;
- Employ creative effects to make clips more engaging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Personal Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
- A cooperative and team-oriented attitude with strong communication skills.&lt;br /&gt;
- Ability to deliver a first draft within 48 hours, and finalize the video within an additional 48 hours.&lt;br /&gt;
- A passion for long-term collaboration and enjoyment of the video editing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Budget and Compensation:&lt;br /&gt;
- The compensation is $100 per video, with an opportunity to produce up to 2 videos weekly.&lt;br /&gt;
- A budget review is scheduled after 15 videos or 2 months, with potential for increase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Application Process:&lt;br /&gt;
If you are passionate about football and possess video editing expertise, please apply with samples of your previous work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Looking forward to potentially working with you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $100
