</description><ns0:encoded>I have a personal brand Youtube channel in the cold email outreach education niche. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Rather than being completely serious, my style has incorporated more of a goofy vibe.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It&amp;#039;s going for a Ryan Trahan or Biaheza style. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I&amp;#039;m able to do the raw cut of the video but need help with the more intricate cuts, transitions, music, and final polish.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;Most importantly, I am looking for someone who can edit with a sense of humor into the content. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

I need help identifying specific moments in an approximately 1.35-hour video by comparing it to 165 still images. The task involves using the file names of the still images, which include the original time codes, to locate the frames in the latest cut of the video. These frames are mostly accurately labeled but may be off by a second or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Project Details:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Video Length: Approximately 1.35 hours&lt;br /&gt;
Number of Stills: 165 images&lt;br /&gt;
Primary Task: Use the file names of the still images to find the matching frames in the higher resolution version of the video on a platform common among video workers. We can discuss the hosting platform, and I am open to hosting elsewhere. Then capture screenshots showing the slightly changed timecode (I will give an example if needed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Instructions:&lt;br /&gt;
-Each still image file name includes a time code (e.g., BS_LB_100.05 should be around 60.5 minutes in the video).&lt;br /&gt;
-Due to slight shifts in the new video cut, the new placement of each still is about 1.65 seconds off from the original time code.&lt;br /&gt;
-Match the stills using the file names and the provided time codes, and capture screenshots using a platform like Frame.io, which has a native capture feature.&lt;br /&gt;
-Download and save the screenshots as per the agreed upon instructions and I can show examples. I will be sure to be mostly around given the turnaround for any questions, but it is quite straightforward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
-Basic experience with various video platforms (the interface is very simple).&lt;br /&gt;
-Attention to detail to ensure accurate frame matching.&lt;br /&gt;
-Ability to start immediately. Preferred completion by the end of the day tomorrow, the 19th of June, or into the evening if needed (Eastern time).&lt;br /&gt;
-Comfortable with signing a basic NDA written in plain language and short and simple - a hassle I prefer to avoid.... but necessary to ensure confidentiality of the video content for this project in particular.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Tools Provided:&lt;br /&gt;
-All necessary tools will be provided.&lt;br /&gt;
-Access to the video and still images via Google Drive, Dropbox, or similar up to freelancer&amp;#039;s preferences/ability.&lt;br /&gt;
-Budget: $75 USD. Milestones are fine if preferred, we&amp;#039;re reasonable and always strive to be fair - long-term business relationships are a great thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Deadline: Preferred by the end of the day tomorrow, the 19th of June - Eastern time - or so. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Note: This task is straightforward and should not be too time-consuming based on our past experiences. I will provide a visual example and be reasonably available to answer any questions in the rare event issues arise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Potential for Future Work: Successful completion of this task may lead to more similar tasks and larger projects in the future, as we often have detailed video analysis needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $75
