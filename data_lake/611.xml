I run a video production studio in Berkeley CA USA. We are producing a lot of corporate and private event videos. I need a few video editors using Adobe Premiere (only) to help us with the editing. I will send you a link to download all the footage (10 to 200 GB), well organized into folders, using Dropbox, and you will send me back the Premiere files only. You need to know the Adobe tools well, be well organized, creative, and cut fast. We are not talking here about highly creative production, it is mostly documenting events: classes, seminars, graduations, speeches, birthdays, weddings, parties, full documentaries and/or highlights. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Since 1998 I have completed more than 8000 projects, and I know very well how to estimate how long it takes to edit each project. I will let you know in advance how many hours to spend on each project as well as a due date. And due dates must be respected. Depending on your skills, I will progressively give you more interesting and creative projects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Please no long introduction letters, just answer the questions below and links to samples of your work&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
