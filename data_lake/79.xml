My name is Bar, and I am looking for a highly skilled and passionate instructor to develop a detailed online course focused on FL Studio. The course, entitled &amp;amp;quot;Mastering FL Studio: From Novice to Expert,&amp;amp;quot; aims to guide students through a comprehensive 10-hour journey into the world of music production using this popular digital audio workstation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here&amp;rsquo;s what I envision for this course:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The course should comprehensively cover FL Studio from the basics to advanced techniques, including sessions on workflow, sound design, mixing, and mastering. Each lesson should start with a face shot introduction explaining the topics and techniques to be covered, followed by screen recording for step-by-step demonstrations within FL Studio. Excellent audio quality is crucial, so a top-notch microphone and screen recording setup are necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Extensive experience and expertise in using FL Studio for music production.&lt;br /&gt;
Ability to explain and demonstrate complex production techniques clearly.&lt;br /&gt;
Experience in teaching music production or creating educational content.&lt;br /&gt;
High-quality video recording and audio capture equipment.&lt;br /&gt;
Interested instructors, please provide:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Your professional background in music production, specifically with FL Studio.&lt;br /&gt;
A detailed outline of the proposed course content, ensuring a logical progression from beginner to advanced levels.&lt;br /&gt;
A sample video or links to your previous instructional content or music projects.&lt;br /&gt;
This is an excellent opportunity to share your expertise and passion for music production, helping aspiring producers master FL Studio and enhance their creative abilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Best regards,&lt;br /&gt;

Guidelines for Crafting a Course with Me &#128522;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Organize the course into lessons lasting 5-20 minutes each, aiming for a total duration of around 10 hours.&lt;br /&gt;
Provide engaging and descriptive titles for each lesson.&lt;br /&gt;

Upload raw footage via Google Drive (please avoid Dropbox or Upwork).&lt;br /&gt;
Include specific editing instructions for our video editor to enhance the educational quality of the videos.&lt;br /&gt;
The first lesson should introduce the course, FL Studio, and any necessary equipment or software.&lt;br /&gt;
Conclude the course with a comprehensive review of all topics covered and encourage students to continue exploring and creating with FL Studio.&lt;br /&gt;
Ensure accuracy and thoroughness in content by comparing it with similar courses.&lt;br /&gt;
Include a 1-minute introductory video for each major section of the course, with scripts provided by me.&lt;br /&gt;
Ensure all videos are delivered in 1920x1080 MP4, H264 format.&lt;br /&gt;

We want the exact same animation with a few modifications:&lt;br /&gt;
- Whenever it says WGN-TV, we would want HTD-TV (the 9 does not have to stay)&lt;br /&gt;
- Instead of 1984 Chicago Cubs Baseball, we would want &amp;amp;quot;2024 Hometown Cup Finals&amp;amp;quot;&lt;br /&gt;
-Instead of the Cubs logo we would want the attached Cup logo&lt;br /&gt;
- We have a video that we can provide to replace the highlights/ads section&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We would need no sound on this file, it would just be to recreate the animation and video portion. I&amp;#039;m not sure if it&amp;#039;s possible to just edit the source file or if the animation would need to be re-done.
