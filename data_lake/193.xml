</description><ns0:encoded>Hi!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking to add two shooting effects to the linked files:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1oBx9yBj7r3D9rOwj9G4UHaRbMDWvq7ec?usp=sharing&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The first file, we would like to add a muzzle flash from the pistol as the man in the bar shoots it (there is a sound effect). For the second file, we would like you to add an out of focus blood wound on the man&amp;#039;s chest as he is hit by the bullet in the dual. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If you are able to create a bullet hole through the girl&amp;#039;s hat with a little smoke after the gun shoots I will pay you extra. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $8
