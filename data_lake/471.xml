We have a bunch of awesome photos and videos that we want to put together into a 3-5 minute video. We even have some cool drone shots too. Let me know if you think we have enough material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The idea is that we don&amp;#039;t really look at the photos that much after the trip, so we want a highlight video that&amp;#039;s easy to watch and remember the best moments. We also want it to look great on social media, to make our friends and strangers jealous &#128513;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- The video should be horizontal, not vertical. But if you think vertical is better, let me know, I&amp;#039;m open to suggestions.&lt;br /&gt;
- You don&amp;#039;t have to only include footage of us, you can also include shots of the beautiful scenery and different places we visited.&lt;br /&gt;
- I want the video to be fun and engaging to watch.&lt;br /&gt;
- If possible, it would be nice to show the different parts of the Philippines we visited (Coron, El Nido, Moalboal, Bohol, and Siargao), but it&amp;#039;s not a must.&lt;br /&gt;
- There are some live photos that can be used as videos, feel free to use them if you think it works.&lt;br /&gt;
- I don&amp;#039;t want to limit your creativity, so feel free to add your own touch &#128513;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking for someone who has some experience with video editing and can show us he/she will do a good job, through previous work. Please attach some of the work you have done when you apply for this job :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Here is a link to all of the photos and videos that we took, it&amp;#039;s quite a lot but most of it is repeated photos:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
https://photos.app.goo.gl/E9esmpP1Ce2LXKyq7&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some of these photos are &amp;amp;quot;live&amp;amp;quot; photos, which can be used as videos, if you feel it&amp;#039;s a good idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Lastly, please give us also an estimate of how long it will take approximately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
