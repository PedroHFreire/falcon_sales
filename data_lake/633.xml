Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;#039;re looking to create a short (2-4 minute) showreel to showcase the business - a group-training fitness studio. We already have lots of pre-edited reels and footage, we just need to edit them together in a seamless way. We&amp;#039;d like to tell a story and weave in the footage together using animated typography. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The ideal person would be intermediate-advanced in video editing with strong skills in animated typography, story telling and compositing. We have around 20 different videos that are edited similarly, but not exactly the same so a creative skillset and capability is ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Bonus if you have experience editing gym/fitness/sports videos!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
