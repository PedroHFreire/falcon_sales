We are a prominent medical YouTube channel seeking a skilled and creative video editor to join our team for our second channel. Our main channel has been active since 2017, focusing on presenter-driven, piece-to-camera content. As we expand, we need a talented editor to create engaging long-form videos and YouTube shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Selection Process:&lt;br /&gt;
We will initially select 4-5 video editors to create 1 long-form YouTube video (2-4 minutes) with high-click-through engaging thumbnail and 1 YouTube short (30-60 seconds) per week. The editor who best meets our criteria for creativity, quality, and adherence to deadlines will be chosen for a long-term collaboration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Note: This position offers the opportunity for a long-term working relationship, with the selected editor expected to produce 52 long-form videos and 52 YouTube shorts annually long-term. For each deliverable&amp;mdash;1 long-form YouTube video (2-4 minutes) with a high-click-through engaging thumbnail and 1 YouTube short (30-60 seconds)&amp;mdash;we offer payment of $80 per week long-term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Responsibilities:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Edit and render 1 long-form YouTube video (2-4 minutes) with high-click-through engaging thumbnail and 1 YouTube short (30-60 seconds) per week.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Perform post-production tasks including color grading, audio enhancement, and adding text, sound effects, images, transitions, and B-roll footage.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Create high-click-through video thumbnails for each long-form video.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Add on-screen subtitles (CC text) for YouTube shorts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Creative Expectations:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Enhancing Viewer Retention: It&amp;#039;s crucial to captivate and retain viewer interest throughout the video. Utilize creative elements such as:&lt;br /&gt;
- Text Overlays: Highlight key points, emphasize important information, or pose questions to encourage viewer interaction.&lt;br /&gt;
- Sound Effects: Integrate appropriate sounds to enhance the atmosphere and reinforce the content&amp;#039;s message.&lt;br /&gt;
- Images: Select relevant visuals that visually support the presenter&amp;#039;s discussion.&lt;br /&gt;
- Fun Transitions: Use creative transitions to maintain visual interest and enhance flow.&lt;br /&gt;
- Title Screens: Design compelling title screens that introduce each video effectively.&lt;br /&gt;
- B-roll Footage: Find and incorporate high-quality B-roll footage that aligns with the topics discussed. We will not specify which footage to use; this is up to your creative judgment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Creativity and Autonomy: Editors are encouraged to showcase their creativity and take ownership of the editing process. You have the freedom to explore different creative approaches and innovate within the video content framework. We value originality; however if you are looking for a good example of editing that we like for you to draw inspiration from here is an example from Dr Mike&amp;#039;s channel on YouTube that we like - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpyGyKct4Us&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Efficiency Expectation:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Our current editor on the main channel completes 1 long-form video with a thumbnail and 1 YouTube short in less than an hour. While we value efficiency, quality remains paramount, and we expect you to deliver polished content that meets our standards consistently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Requirements:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Proven experience in video editing, preferably in a similar genre.&lt;br /&gt;
Ability to work autonomously, meet deadlines, and deliver high-quality content consistently.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Strong attention to detail and a keen eye for visual storytelling.&lt;br /&gt;
Proficiency in editing software and tools necessary for high-quality video production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
What We Provide:&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; High-quality 4K footage for each scene of the long-form videos, supplied as individual files for efficient editing.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; Video scripts for guidance on content structure and order.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;bull; 24/7 availability for questions and support during the editing process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $80
