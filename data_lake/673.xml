An experienced, creative and professional Video Editor who has a keen attention to detail and loves working with market-leading, fast-growing businesses on interesting projects. &#128640;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
# Experience #&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;#039;d love to work with you if you have experience editing and publishing video, especially for social media and YouTube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Bonus points if you also have experience with publishing podcasts (audio editing + submitting to iTunes, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
# Who We Are #&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are MemberFix&amp;mdash;the #1 WordPress Membership Site Tech Agency in the world. &#128170;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We help $1MM+ WordPress-based membership / eLearning businesses solve technical challenges via custom development services and leading edge hosting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And we support and host some of the most exciting and well-known membership sites and brands in the world, across a wide variety of verticals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Our Core Values are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- We are innovative&lt;br /&gt;
- We are resourceful&lt;br /&gt;
- We get things done&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
# The Collaboration #&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1 - Together, we will produce a variety of video content on a predictable publishing schedule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Types of content include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Interviews&lt;br /&gt;
- Case Studies&lt;br /&gt;
- Tutorials&lt;br /&gt;
- Solo podcasts (talking head)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
2 - The formats that we&amp;#039;ll publish in include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Full size HD interview videos (for YouTube mainly)&lt;br /&gt;
- Reels (for IG, Facebook, TikTok, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;
- Social Media posts (Insta, FB, LinkedIn)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3 - The main platforms we&amp;#039;ll be using are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- YouTube&lt;br /&gt;
- iTunes / Google&amp;#039;s podcast platform&lt;br /&gt;
- LinkedIn&lt;br /&gt;
- Facebook&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;#039;ll also experiment with:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Instagram&lt;br /&gt;
- TikTok&lt;br /&gt;
- Reddit&lt;br /&gt;
- X&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
4 - MemberFix will provide a subscription to any necessary software in order to produce the best content. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Currently we use Kapwing and Veed.io but you can use any tools you&amp;#039;re comfortable with. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
5 - The following are examples of the type of work you&amp;#039;ll be asked to do:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Remove silences&lt;br /&gt;
- Remove filler words&lt;br /&gt;
- Clean / improve audio&lt;br /&gt;
- Normalize audio&lt;br /&gt;
- Edit out specified parts of video / audio&lt;br /&gt;
- Generate and edit captions&lt;br /&gt;
- Generate reels&lt;br /&gt;
- Upload files to a shared Google Drive folder&lt;br /&gt;
- Upload finished media to Social Media&lt;br /&gt;
- Collaborate together within ClickUp on our Kanban board&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
...many of these functions are performed automatically using AI video editing tools. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However, you would also be responsible for ensuring that the final media is polished, e.g.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
- Captions are accurate&lt;br /&gt;
- No strange clipping or jerky edits&lt;br /&gt;
- Audio and video are as high quality as can be &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
6 - Here&amp;#039;s what we expect of you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A) Clear, direct communication&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This means being direct with what you need from our side to do your best work, managing OUR expectations, and keeping us updated per our mutual agreement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Beating around the bush and being overly diplomatic is not our style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Say what you have to say politely, but say it directly! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
B) Professionalism&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have a zero tolerance policy for excuses, complaining, missed deadlines, long lapses in communication, preventable mistakes, and poor quality / reduced quality output. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Note: you will never be held accountable for anything we haven&amp;#039;t made explicitly clear&amp;mdash;that is OUR job. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
However, once we&amp;#039;ve clarified and documented exactly what to do and what&amp;#039;s expected of you, we will hold you to those standards. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
TLDR; if you&amp;#039;re a professional you have absolutely nothing to worry about. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
C) Timeliness&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Publishing content requires consistency and honoring our content calendar. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore, we expect deadlines to be taken seriously from both our side and yours. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
D) Proactivity&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
While we provide documentation, training, etc., we do not micromanage our team members. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore, we expect you to take be proactive in your duties and make decisions according to your best judgement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
If something needs to be done, you will take it upon yourself to do it without being asked or prompted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
E) Growth mindset&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This includes the ability to respond appropriately to constructive criticism, and to use every situation as an opportunity to learn and improve. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We&amp;#039;re looking for free-thinking team members for a long term collaboration, not robots!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The right individual also has the opportunity to grow to the next level WITH us, both professionally and personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I look forward to meeting with you soon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
