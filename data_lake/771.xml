Hello! &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I need you to immediately join our team for transcription services. You would be asked to view existing SoMe channels and their videos online. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
You are asked to accurately note&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
* The URL of the SoMe video &lt;br /&gt;
* Duration of video &lt;br /&gt;
* Amount of views &lt;br /&gt;
* Transcribe the English language videos, including roles, if there are multiple speakers &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Your output would be to Google Doc. Something like: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
ROLE A: &amp;amp;quot;At this moment in time, the exchange rate of gold has gone down, and we are looking into the abyss regarding any technical progress. Caution all!&amp;amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
ROLE B: &amp;amp;quot;Yes, Stephan, I agree with you - however, let&amp;#039;s look into the prices of copper and gold today&amp;amp;quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
BUDGET: For every one minute of live video transcribed and approved, you will receive 4 minutes pay.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;So, for every approved hour billed to us, you must have accurately transcribed 15 minutes of live video.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are looking for an immediate start, and can provide about 10 hours weekly to start with. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Looking forward to hearing from you &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hourly Range&lt;/b&gt;: $4.00-$8.00

I shoot in SLOG 3 with Sony A7S3 and you must be good at color grading to match the mood and tone of the brand. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This project is 20 - 30 second reels but it&amp;#039;s not about the length its more about your storytelling in your editing.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;The nuances etc. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The restaurant is like a lounge so Jazz is preferred. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Anyway, you must be efficient at receiving Google drives full of video clips and chopping them up to make vibe reels. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I will upload a folder of the inspiration. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Just confirm and shree with me your past work so we can move forward. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This project will be the beginning because I will do an official shoot next week. this was their soft launch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
so here is the inspo video&amp;#039;s let me know if you can create in the world,&lt;br /&gt;
