Here are the primary tasks:&lt;br /&gt;
1) Crop and center the images so the sun/moon are moving down and to the right of the image&lt;br /&gt;
2) Adjust the colors and lighting so the images are consistent throughout that video. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Task #1 is the highest priority item. I have them as .ARW (Sony raw) but am happy to convert them. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Attached is what the images look like when they are put in video form. It close to a great video but it&amp;#039;s still a bit far away. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Any help would be greatly appreciated. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

We have a Golf training aid called TRAIN YOUR PLANE&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We are launching it into the U.S market soon&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need a TEAM (Company) that has EXTENSIVE experience who can provide the following services:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Edit our videos and photos &lt;br /&gt;
2. Create attractive and professional video social media ads&lt;br /&gt;
3. Create advertising campaigns and set up social media ads. We are thinking Facebook, YouTube, Instagram etc&lt;br /&gt;
4. Manage our social media ad campaigns and report to us weekly &lt;br /&gt;
4. Post and manage our social media content full time &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We have a photo and video shoot scheduled in two weeks. We have a professional photographer and videographer here in Sydney we use, we will share these images and videos with you via Google Drive or Dropbox etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We need to work closely with you to get RESULTS. We need to be able to see and monitor the results of the strategies, campaigns, advertising etc &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
We understand there are two costs to our business:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Monthly cost to use your full services&lt;br /&gt;
2. Monthly advertising spend&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have provided some sample images below, please look but do not use these images, as the product, logo and the product box are all being redesigned as we speak. We will obviously share all the new designs with the successful company in the near future &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
