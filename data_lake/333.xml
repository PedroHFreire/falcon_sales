My social media management company has 2 levels of content &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Package 1 &lt;br /&gt;
8 reels &lt;br /&gt;
8 images &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Package 2-4 &lt;br /&gt;
16 reels &lt;br /&gt;
16 images &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The images there will be 2 versions a square format for Instagram posts and a rectangle format for story uploads &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The posts i want them to be edited in a way where we remove the background of that specific product or item and put either a plain black or plain white background or something nice to match the theme of the business &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Half the reels in both packages i want edited with captions , an example would be like this link: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8Oo4ApC6bB/?igsh=ZjF5aTdmN3Nhejh1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I understand that video is a motivational video but i service different businesses so that editing might not apply to the content i will be recording but that will be the job of the editor to suit it towards the content. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The content i will send you will consist of various businesses. For example&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;mouth guard business, chiropractor, dental clinic , gym , restaurant , take away shop and others &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My photographer will take all the videos and photos and you will have access to that file to extract whatever content you need from&lt;br /&gt;
Them &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To make it easier if there is not enough content you can re use the same clip 2 times&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;as long as there&amp;rsquo;s spread apart so they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to similar to each other (the reels) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The images will sometimes need to be extracted from the videos because the photographer will mainly take videos not photos &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I will provide the content in raw format and your job will be to edit them and turn them into reels and images &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I will be using ASANA and it will be your job to use it as well to track your tasks for each project &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When you complete the work for each project they must be separated in the file link that you send over by week there will be more detail on this if you would like the position &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I will pay either by project or by month depending on the situation &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
My budget for this position will be $50USD if you can not do this budget please do not apply for the position &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I have provided all the information if it suits your requirements please respond back and we can begin &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I am after 5 people in total because the position will become very busy over time. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
