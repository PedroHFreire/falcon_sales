I am launching my own interior design company and have already completed the logo and branding, which is inspired by the circular color palettes provided in paint shops like Jotun. I want to create a promotional video for my brand that highlights this concept with vibrant, popping colors. I&amp;#039;m looking for someone skilled in Illustrator and storytelling to bring this vision to life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;Budget&lt;/b&gt;: $40
